Presently  the tool that retrieves future dividend estimates  ex-dividend + payment dates  and NAVs only works for Canadian stocks and ETFs; you would either have to write your own script or enter these data in manually for non-Canadian investments.

It looked kind of bullish to me. So I placed a call that expires in February just to see if I can make a little money. Today they opened at $20.20 and closed at $23.98. I gained 123% for the day. Didn’t think I was going to make that much.I think this would be a good candidate for long term gains. However  most recent IPOed companies tend to have a short period of rise then either level off or drop a lot then level off with a slight increase. A good example is Quantumscape (QS). I made 200% gains which was nice. :)Let me know what ya’ll think. :)P.S. I’m still going to buy stocks/calls for QS. Just waiting for signs of bullish behavior. =)EDIT: Opps.

I know this is normal and there are various reasons for the dip like end of year sell off and I think some sort of special dividend was announced.

I hope we all have a better year in 2021. &#x200B;I wanted to post about Teladoc Health. Let me know if any of this information is incorrect  but I am just posting what I've found online. I think this is an extremely interesting and unique investment. They are the global leader in telemedicine  and I believe this is the way the future is moving. A study showed that 76% of consumers are interested in virtual care after COVID  as opposed to only 11% of people showing interest before COVID. I think COVID has made a permanent  ever lasting change in the way people view health and virtual appointments. 33% of people said they would leave their current physician to access virtual care as an alternative  and 66% of patients want their current physician to partner with a telehealth provider so that they can access care virtually. &#x200B;The generalized bull care for virtual health is; 1. Saves doctors and patients time travelling to and from the place of appointment  2. Patients are more comfortable to do appointments from the comfort of their home  3. Insurers will almost guaranteed charge less for virtual appointments. The generalized bear case would show that virtual care cannot provide sufficient details as a physical appointment would  and you cannot check normal vitals such as blood pressure  etc. Most of the time the doctor will send you for bloodwork anyways  so accessing that prescription online is completely fine. &#x200B;Basing most of these financials off of their latest release (3Q2020). YoY Q3 revenues increased 109% to 289M. Total visits increased 206% to 2.8 million for the quarter. For the first 3 quarters  their revenue grew 79% to 711M and total visits increased 163% to 7.6 million. For the FULL fiscal year 2020  their **revenue is expected to grow 96% to 1.09B**. Assuming the 4th quarter visits are the same  they should have around **10 million visits for the full year**  which would be **\~140% visitation growth YoY** (in financial statements they actually say around 10.5 million visits is expected  so a little more than 140%). It is clear visits are skyrocketing and revenues are growing very quick as well. Net loss per share in 2019 was 1.38  as opposed to the expected net loss per share in 2020 to be 1.28  just a 7% increase. This would put Teladoc at a 27 P/S ratio  pretty high; and earnings are still heavily negative. They are going to burn over 100M in losses this year  and with only 1.19B in cash and 1B in debt; the fundamentals don't look all that fantastic. &#x200B;Looking forward  the EPS for 2021 are expected to be a loss of 54 (per share)  a 58% increase YoY  up from the expected 7% for 2020. Revenues are expected to climb aggressively again to 1.95B  an 80% increase YoY. According to 22 analysts Teladoc's first profitable year will be 2023  where they will make 163M. So based off 2 more years of  losses  this means if they continue business as is they will burn less than 200M of their 1B cash  and perhaps can use that remaining cash to worry about short term debt (which they have a lot). I could also see them doing another offering of shares to raise capital one last time for continued aggressive expansion.&#x200B;Teladoc has had a 67% CAGR in revenue from 2015-2020  so this basically demolishes the idea that it is a COVID stock or stay-at-home stock. It has had consistent growth since 2015  but this isn't to say that COVID hasn't helped them. COVID has forced/gave people the choice to move their healthcare virtually  and Teladoc claims they have a 90% client retention rate. Meaning most people who try Teladoc once  continue to use it  a great sign. Just looking back into 2018 until now  they have provided free telehealth visits for those affected by Hurricane Florence  Lane  Laura and Sally - as well as California/Western Wildfires. With a 90% retention rate a lot of the individuals who take advantage of these visits probably stay on as permanent Teladoc patients; a fantastic business move while giving positive press regarding the company. In 2019 Teladoc also partnered with Johnston Group - in which 30 000 small to medium sized businesses with the Chambers of Commerce Group Insurance Plan would be able to use their platform.&#x200B;**Intel** recently donated to the **World Telehealth Initiative (WTI)**  a non-profit organization who will leverage Teladoc's telemedicine platform to expand access to care in less developed countries. Teladoc Health has received an endorsement from the **National Labor Alliance of Health Care Coalitions (NLA)** \[the largest alliance of labor unions and labor management coalitions\] and 2 accreditations though **ClearHealth Quality Institute Telemedicine Accreditation Program (TAP)**. Nationally recognized agencies are giving Teladoc public compliments. Just added publicity is good. &#x200B;They have expanded to give access to virtual healthcare  nutrition services with access to actual nutritionists  mental health care services with access to psychiatrists/psychologists. Teladoc has presence in **175+ countries**  and 60 of the top 100 hospitals use Teladoc and Livongo solutions to run their operations. With the acquisition of Livongo  Teladoc has added another exceptional dimension to its business. Livongo provides managed care for chronic illness patients; it collects data and leans on artificial intelligence to come up with solutions and tips those patients to live healthier lives. On their own  Livongo are a positive earning company and have only captured 1% of their addressable market in the U.S. Primarily they deal with diabetic patients and have near-doubled their diabetic patient count in each of the last 4 years. Paired with Teladoc  Livongo believes they can offer its services to over 50 000 members with diabetes; and their solutions can be applied to many more chronic illnesses. &#x200B;Teladoc also acquired **MedecinDirect** \- the market leading telemedicine provider in France. In September 2018 they announced Teladoc Global Care Services - 24/7 worldwide service. Looking at the global growth we can see from 2017 to 2019; revenue from outside-of-the-U.S sources was 19M  75M  108M in 2017  2018 and 2019 respectively. Just for reference; revenue from inside-the-U.S sources was 215M  343M  and 445M in 2017  2018 and 2019 respectively. We can see that the proportion of revenue from outside of the U.S is growing on a % basis - a very good sign for Teladoc; meaning their goal of diversifying and expanding their network is working. In 2020 over 20% of their revenue will come from outside the U.S. &#x200B;The average rating from 27 analysts is $242.78  a 20% upside from current price  with a high of $305  over 50% upside from current price. Yahoo rates Teladoc a 2.1 between a Hold (3) and a Buy (2) - closer to a Buy. On SeekingAlpha it is rated at just above a 4  which implies Bullish. Walletinvestor expects a 1-Year Forecast of $340 (71% upside)  and a 5-Year Forecast of $873 (335% upside). Govcapital gives a 1-Year Forecast of $345 (73% upside)  and a 5-Year Forecast of $1335 (565% upside). &#x200B;Some of these values are slightly rounded  taken as of December 31  2020. **ARKK**'s 5th largest holding is TDOC at 4.31% (3 882 585 shares at a value of $790 377 828). **ARKW**'s 5th largest holding is TDOC at 3.53% (933 334 shares at a value of $189 998 802). **ARKG**'s 3rd largest holding is TDOC at 5.75% (2 249 762 shares at a value of $457 984 050). **ARKF**'s 36th largest holding is TDOC at 1.05% (103 554 shares at a value of $21 080 488). Together this means that 4 of the 5 ARK funds hold this company. The 4 funds that do have Teladoc shares have **7 169 235 shares** at a value of **$1 459 441 168**  or an average share price of **$203.57/share** (a 1.8% downside off of December 31  2020 closing price). In the past few weeks/months ARK funds have been buying into this company heavily. Do we really think they would invest 1.5 billion USD into it if they didn't believe it would be a good company  with good growth  near and long term? &#x200B;In total there is 61% institutional holding. There is also 6% insider holding  meaning they have a lot of money in the company. In the past 12 months insiders have sold 822 242 shares and bought 104 618 shares. That means a net of 717  624 share sold  which makes sense because it had a huge growth year. &#x200B;Teladoc has a very high volatility it seems  with over 10% of shares shorted as of December 15  2020. This is down from November in which 15% of shares were shorted. So if you are currently  or looking to invest into the Teladoc Health company  expect a high level of volatility. &#x200B;**Disclaimer:** I do **NOT** hold a position in Teladoc but am heavily eyeing it. I think it shows great signs of a growth company. Another really large benefit is they are a medical stock; they do nothing but good for the people. They provide healthcare virtually in regions where doctors give insufficient care or where there is no care at all. Who doesn't want to invest in something that helps people while also getting good returns? I personally think that it seems like a sound company for a small position. &#x200B;Any discussion would be awesome! As always  **do your own due diligence**  I highly encourage it. Into the New Year I wish everyone well wishes  and good luck! &#x200B;What does everyone think about Teladoc Health? Do they believe it is just a stay-at-home stock? Are you buying into it?,self,https://redd.it/ko3pmx

But now I’m confused  does it still happen if you’re trading often? At first I was thinking just being in the stock market in general was enough no matter how much you bought and sold but now I’ve seen some things in videos or articles making it seem like if you’re selling you’re not letting your compound interest work.

I have a decent experience in valuation but haven't really explored the pharma segment. My query is how do you project the sales of a pharma company. Their portfolio is huge  a company I'm working on has more than 1500 products  even if i project them using their segmental growth rate  it's very much possible that'll end up with inaccurate figures. If yes  then how to go about it? How to project sales of new product launches and the overall marketing expenses or SG&A  will broad assumptions work in this case or should i drill down to individual products. Owing to this uncertainty is it safe to say that relative Valuation works better than DCF. Please help me with these queries. Thank youOh and a Happy New year folks,self,https://redd.it/ko6vlc

(Yes  it would have been nice to get in much earlier  but I missed that boat) All was well  I was up about 12%. Fast forward a few months  the stock is now down 34.95% over the past 30 days  currently trading at $80.99. My initial plan for this stock was long long term. My rationale was:- They’re a small company focused on COVID almost exclusively  so if successful  there should be considerable growth. - They’re partnered with Pfizer  hopefully this should provide some additional level of insurance. - At a minimum  they will be involved with the vaccination of 50 million Americans via the $2 billion order placed through Pfizer by the American government. They’re vaccinating elsewhere as well obviously. - Vaccine is 95% effective  etc... And  if the vaccine requires modification to treat evolved strains  BNTX has stated that can be accomplished in 6 weeks. For me  the big picture looked good.Currently  my thinking is that I should just ride it out long term. Maybe once the administration changes and takes a more aggressive approach to vaccination  people will feel more optimistic. Or  maybe a few years down the road BNTX will be acquired...Part obviously part of me also thinks I should stop the bleeding now before I take a complete bath. Is it possible this can drop further? I don’t have a lot of experience with biotechnology stocks.Thanks in advance.,self,https://redd.it/kocn35

Is it undervalued after the 37% drop due to Cyberpunk problems on consoles?,Ticker Discussion,0.9,221,0,1,116,0,**Background**CD PROJEKT S.A. (WSE: CDR) is a Polish video game developer  publisher and distributor based in Warsaw. CD Projekt Red  best known for The Witcher series and the recent release of Cyberpunk 2077.The CD PROJEKT Group currently conducts operating activities in two key segments: CD PROJEKT RED and GOG.com (originally as Good Old Games).**Hierarchy**CD PROJEKT Capital Group is headed by CD PROJEKT S.A. A holding company which has five subsidiaries.The subsidiaries are:\- GOG sp. z o.o (Similar to Steam  it is a distributor of games).\- CD PROJEKT Inc (Where all the game development happens)\- CD PROJEKT Co. Ltd (Only for selling games in China)\- Spokko sp. z o.o. (The mobile arm of CD projekt red)\- CD PROJEKT RED STORE sp. z o.o. (A new store of merchandise launched by the company)**GOG -** Who have just released a 2.0 version called GOG Galaxy which subsequently entered its beta testing phase. The goal of the application is to enable players to integrate all their game shelves into a single library  to communicate with friends and to track their progress regardless of their preferred gaming platforms. Its functionality will span PC and console platforms  extending beyond the GOG.com user base. It's main selling points are that is uses the cloud  is DRM free and has a ton of old games such as Diablo  Destroy all humans etc on it's platform that Steam doesn't.Steam is the single biggest distributor of digital games for PC  it's been dominating the market for years and has way more games than GOG does due to this. Especially as a lot of publishers do not want to host their games DRM free which GOG requires. It's very difficult to predict the future of GOG because Steam is a private company so we don't have access to it's numbers.However the big benefit of GOG is that CD Projekt Red can sell and promote it's games directly through their own platform. The benefit being a much bigger margin on each game sold as 100% of the profit goes to CD Projekt red if a game is sold on GOG  whereas on Steam they take a 20% cut for the first $50m revenue of Cyberpunk. **One third** of all digital PC preorders for Cyberpunk 2077 sales were on GOG which is an incredible achievement by CD Projekt Red considering Steams dominance.This is probably the reason why CD Projekt Red has such a huge operating margin from 30% to 50% in recent years. They are involved in the entire process of making and selling their games.***GWENT: The Witcher Card Game*** is the first multiplayer game developed by the CD PROJEKT Group. It has been a hugely successful and highly rated game (which is impressive considering it's their first mobile multiplayer game). The reason why this game is important for the future is because multiplayer is the key to the cash machine which is microtransactions which the card game has.**Cyberpunk** was released recently and had been in development for many years. It's sold very well but less than analysts expectations and there has been serious problems on console versions which led to sony removing cyberpunk 2077 from it's PS store for the time being. This caused the companies stock to plummet 37% recently.I'll get into the numbers at the bottom for my reverse DCF that I did.**Cyberpunk Online** multiplayer will definitely come at some point within the next couple of years. The reason being is that after GTA Onlines unbelievable success and constant revenue generation for Take Two then it makes sense to try and replicate this with Cyberpunk. This multiplayer will feature microtransactions and in my opinion is the way Cd Projekt red can really make the big $$ in the future. Microtransactions for cosmetic items like in game skins or packs (like fifa) are easy to implement and have huge operating margins as they take 0 CAPEX and virtually no time to implement due to being some simple code and designs. Here's a quote taken from their 2019 Annual Report for *Key Sources Of Revenue*:>■ sales carried out through optional microtransactions in GWENT: The Witcher Card Game (incl. kegs and meteorite dust) via GOG  proprietors of console platforms (PlayStation  Xbox) and App Store (Apple)**Risks**There are some huge risks with cd projekt red  here are the main ones:\- Neither IP  The Wither or Cyberpunk 2077 is owned by CD Projekt since the two series are based on a series of novels and a tabletop RPG respectively. So they would need permission from these license holders (the creators I think) to be able to do other spin offs for them. While it is likely the permission will be given due to the huge successes it's not a certainty.\- CD Projekt Red relies on a couple of block busters to make 80% of their revenue and earnings. The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the only revenue generates the company has (apart from GOG). If CD Projekt red messes up either of these huge IP's in the future (or like they just have with the console versions of Cyberpunk) then you can expect a huge and sudden stock price drop and potential damage to the company.\- Because of the few but huge releases  CD Projekt Red has very volatile earnings and revenue making it very hard to predict  similar to Take Two Interactive. You can see in the following picture how sales drop a lot after release.**Co-Founders and Board History**CD PROJEKT has a very long tenure of the management board  all at least 10 years and 3/5 of them 20+ years. Insiders have a significant stake in CD Projekt red's stock  including the joint CEO's. This is great news for shareholders as the insiders have a big incentive to make the company work as they have big stakes in the company.Company shareholding structure is made up of the following people:\- **Marcin Iwinski** (Joint CEO & Co-Founder) is **13%**\- **Michal Kicinski** (Ex Joint CEO & Co-Founder) is **11%**\- **Piotr Nielubowicz** (VP  CFO) is **6%**\- **Adam Kicinski** (President & Joint CEO) is **3%**Incentives for management:>Management goals are based 80% on net earnings and 20% on SP over the WIG index.These are poor goals in my opinion. Net earnings can be enhanced by poor acquisitions and stock price is meaningless and should be ignored in incentives as it can produce short term motivations.Management hit the majority of their goals for year 2019.Their goals going forward:>Goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 8 300 PLN or 1 660 PLN a year.  >  >Optimistic goals for 2020-2025 Aggregate Net Income: 10 000 PLN or 2 000 PLN a year.These goals seem too high in my opinion. Especially after their cyberpunk flop on consoles but it's still possible.**Competitors**CD PROJEKT is well known for its biggest sales on The Witcher and Cyberpunk 2077 hype. However  there’s a lot of gaming industries that compete with one another.Thus comparing its competitors such as Take-Two Interactive  Electronic Arts (EA)  Activision Blizzard has more diversified games and games produced more frequently compared to CD PROJEKT RED.CD Projekt Red's risk in terms of competitors is releasing a big game that clashes with another big game such as GTA 6. However all gaming companies have a good tailwind right now due to COVID restrictions and microtransactions are lifting all gaming companies margins. A rising tide lifts all boats.**Industry**>**-** CAGR 2019-2024 Video games and e-sports growth expected to be 7% (source: PWC Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2020–2024).  >  >\- In 2019 the strongest strong growth was observed in the mobile and console segments. The former grew by 9.7%  reaching 68.2 billion USD  while the latter grew by 7.3%  reaching 45.3billion USD. The PC market reached a volume of 35.3 billion USD  having increased by 2.8%.The largest share of the global videogame market is currently held by mobile devices (46%)  80% of which are smartphone releases. Gaming consoles come in second at 30%  followed by the PC 24%. Mobile devices are projected to retain their top position  with their corresponding market volume increasing by 11.2% annually (on average) over the next three years. According to estimates  the volume of the global mobile game market will reach 93.6 billion USD by 2022 (it currently stands at 68.2 billion USD).You can see from the above as to why CD projekt red is branching out to smartphones and China.**Reverse DCF**Here's the original post and reverse DCF because r/stocks does not allow images: [https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr\_cd\_projekt\_red\_analysis\_is\_it\_undervalued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UndervaluedStonks/comments/kofhq7/wsecdr_cd_projekt_red_analysis_is_it_undervalued/)**Conclusion**It's been extremely difficult to project CD Projekt Red and even after doing research I am still very unsure on a bunch of variables. In my opinion the markets assumptions of CD Projekt Red's growth and margins as shown above in the reverse DCF is perfectly acceptable to me. Therefore I would not buy their shares unless they dipped to around 210 zloty\~ as I don't think they are undervalued yet. given the risks.Please comment if you see anything wrong with my valuation. This was a very difficult one for me.Thanks,self,https://redd.it/kofurl

Individuals who are looking to to enter and exit a trade on the same day (day trade) more than 3 times a week are restricted in doing so by the Pattern Day-Trade Rule or  “PDT”. There are important exceptions to this rule that new investors should understand and consider.1. Does not apply to cash accounts2. Does not apply to accounts LARGER than 25k3. For every one account you open you get 3 day trades a week.Assuming most of us don’t have $25 000 to put into an investing account right away and opening multiple accounts can over complicate your investing  we are going to go with **opening a cash account.**A cash account in investing is a direct/non-credit account. This means you will receive no margin/funds from your [broker](https://tdameritrade.com/) to invest with on top of your initial cash balance. **There is no day trading limit on cash accounts**  keep in mind though this also means you will have to wait for your money to clear which usually takes 2-3 days from the closing date of a stock position. **Good news for options traders!** Funds from your daily option buying and selling are available the next day for you to trade with  without the PDT rule. Funds recieved from closing option contracts take less time to clear than funds recived from closing stock positions.Many traders will allocate the amount of money they will use to buy and sell options. For new traders  lets say I have $1000  I am going to put $800 in long term positions and use $200 to trade options. If I buy an AMD contact for $180  even if I sell that AMD contract right after buying it  that $180 won’t be available for me to use again until it has cleared the following morning. This is one of the many reasons why it is important for small account holders to plan their trades  ensuring they will have funds available to them for their planned entrances.That’s it… a cash account is the best option by far for aspiring day traders.\* make sure to Pay attention to the account type you have opened with your broker. They want everyone to open a margin account. Financially this makes the most since for them  but maybe not for you.,self,https://redd.it/kogel8

Info in comments.,Advice,0.7,6,0,0,12,0,I have 2 accounts at TD Ameritrade. One is a regular trading account I opened in 2007. The other is a Roth IRA I opened in 2015. I will turn 61 in April.The regular trading account I use to play with stocks. I only have $5K in it.The Roth IRA account is obviously my retirement account.I am thinking it makes more sense to put money in the Roth IRA only since I can always withdraw contributions freely and gains and dividends are tax free. My current financial situation allows me to contribute about $5K annually into the Roth IRA. So again  I am thinking  say I have $1K to do something with. I should put it in the IRA so that I can make sure I am working towards the max annual contribution. And putting it in the Roth IRA rather than the regular trading acct  the tax implications are more advantageous.I realize than any thing over the max (including the catch up) would have to go in to the regular trading acct.So my thinking is that there is no real reason to put money in the regular acct unless I am going to exceed the max contribution amount.

I call the metric Price Elasticity and it is comprised of two numbers: upturn elasticity and downturn elasticity.* Upturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market up days* Downturn elasticity: the average % change in a stock on market down daysUsing these numbers and a few additional basic requirements (like positive EPS and at least 31 days of trading history)  my screener found 99 stocks out of about 5700 searched that have good to exceptional price elasticities. (the list of these stocks is linked below and also [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing))# What makes for good price elasticity numbers?I made two classifications for stocks with good price elasticity data.1. **Irrational** \- Upturn elasticity > 1  Downturn elasticity < 02. **Responsible** \- Upturn elasticity > 1  0 < Downturn elasticity < 1With any stock I want an upturn elasticity > 1  meaning that the stock tends to move higher than the market when the market goes up. The Irrational classification gets its name because if a stock's downturn elasticity is negative this means the stock  on average  moves up when the market goes down. So a stock that moves higher than the market when the market goes up and also moves up when the market goes down is classified as Irrational. These stocks tend to have less trading history and are very volatile.Then there are Responsible stocks which like Irrational stocks move higher than the market when the market goes up. Unlike Irrational stocks though  Responsible stocks move lower when the market moves lower. The reason I still consider them good is because their downturn elasticity is <1 and >0  meaning that  while they do move down with the market  they move down to a lesser degree.Some popular stocks picked up by the screener include: AMD  ADSK  ETSY  NFLX  NVDA  SHOP and TSLA. Many of the other stocks have lower market caps and could be interesting value / growth plays given they too made the cut.# Link to the 99 stocks found:[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NsbQ42oo6i3kYUWf96Tw5yK3LD04L1CR/view?usp=sharing)&#x200B;I have no idea if there is merit to my Price Elasticity metric (or if it has already been invented) but it was a fun project and the screener found some interesting stocks I would have never discovered otherwise. The validity of the metric is entirely based on the assumption that past trends indicate future performance  and for those looking to beat the market the trends of these 99 stocks should be very appealing. I made the screener using Python3 and TD Ameritrade's API. Of the stocks in that list I am currently holding AMD  CAMT  EPAM  and NLOK.Edit: Happy New Year,self,https://redd.it/kogze1

What is your investor sentiment on its mid-long term trajectory?,Advice,0.46,0,0,0,35,0,Hi r/Stocks I purchased 100 shares in $ZM (Zoom) during Q3 earnings (November) for around $470 per share. It seemed to me as if it had great mid to long term potential so I’ve been buying the “dips” since then  $ZM is now down 30% from Q3 highs. My total [current investment](https://imgur.com/gallery/t8VHLNz) is about $140 000 and I’m down 19% (around $25 000 less). I’m conducting research to identify whether I should hold and continue to buy the dips or sell for a loss and move on. Part of my research  is leading me to discuss on a finance forum. Therefore  I am writing to collect investors sentiment on Zoom stock. The question is aimed at those who study equities / those in the finance profession  not for general index fund investors. No one can predict the future  but we can discuss probabilities and general sentiments based on the resources (ex. fundamentals) and variables (ex. technicals) we have - that is what I’m looking for. What is your general sentiment over the next short term (quarter)  mid-term (year)  and long term (years)?—— * EDIT * ——I want to thank everyone for the responses and wish you all a Happy New Year!I will continue to conduct further research and view how the stock reacts opening week. Thereafter  I will consider whether to scale out slowly (selling around $10K-$20K worth of shares periodically). If any catalysts like $ZMs February earnings or price movement reverses to a bullish trend  I will maintain my position. If there is no pre-anticipatory run  it is fine  I will exit completely by February and rebalance my portfolio.,self,https://redd.it/kokzvw

I read over margin on Fidelity’s website and I can not make heads or tails of it. (Numbers below are rounded and off by a couple dollars here and there)Under Balances in my Roth at Fidelity: My cash core says $16 000. Below that line  I see a negative cash debit of $289 that I am guessing is somehow from an option I hold. Is that causing interest to be charged? Cash available to trade and withdraw says $183. Why wouldn’t the cash go to cover the $289 and prevent interest being charged? I asked a Fidelity rep who said read about it and was condescending and unhelpful. I don’t think he understood it either  but he didn’t want to admit that.In my individual account under Balances: margin equity percentage 97.8 percent  cash buying power $3097  settled cash $3192  cash core $3100  margin debit - $359   margin accrued $15.39I don’t understand what is causing the interest charge exactly. It defaults to margin when I make trades which is frustrating and I forget to switch it to cash half the time. I am calling Mon to get the margin taken off but don’t want to ask them these questions after the rudeness of the other rep I sell covered calls and covered puts and buy long calls. Mostly I trade stocks and hold at least a few days often years.Thanks for any help you can give.,self,https://redd.it/kolaeq

Not like billionaire wealthy  but have a nice 2500 sq foot home  25000 car  and still enough money and time and money to do stuff I love  and be able to pay for it without worry. Everybody keeps telling me to invest in stocks. Are stocks really something that could do this for me? Or do stocks not really pay off until retirement like an IRA? Any advice you guys can give me please comment. As I am a stock noob. TLDR; I’m young and don’t feel like going to college  but want enough money to be able to pay for and do things I love. Can stocks sort of be a passive income for a person like me?TLDR the TLDR; Don’t like school want money to have fun. Should I do stocks.,self,https://redd.it/kollze

One is Greenlane Renewables (GRN) and the other is Loop Insights (MTRX). They both operate in different industries with long term tailwinds ahead for them.i have been monitoring them for quite some time and did enough DD to convince me they are great long term holds.Greenlane is a renewable natural gas industry which decarbonizes and converts biogas Into renewable natural gas. Their recent earnings report shows a profit for the first time. I consider them a leader in this industry because they're the only RNG company that uses all 3 gas separation techniques: power washing  membrane separation  and adsorption. The natural gas industry is set to take off this decade and is shown to be more efficient than clean renewable energy while still better for the environment than traditional gas. I bought 782 shares of GRN.Loop insights is a data company that has gives retail insights  to its clients and monitors consumer spending to personalize offers for customers. They have a 100% successful venue bubble for COVID contact tracing and they have 2 products released on the Telus IoT marketplace (renewed their telus partnership again). They recently announced a partnership with NTT data which is the 4th largest IoT provider in the world. They're revolutionary product Uklipz is a video review tool that gives real time info and reviews on a retail store from verified users. Amazon and other big companies have come to Loop insights for this product due to the amount of fake reviews plaguing their sites. Loop also recently released a digital health platform where provincial health systems can connect with eachother on big issues surrounding the healthcare industry. Individuals can also access their medical records online and book appointments with their family doctors. I bought 440 shares of MTRX.I gave short summaries for both companies I invested in and feel they have great long term potential for this year and beyond. One is in the RNG space while the other is in Data and AI/IoT. What do you think about these 2 companies? Do you see 2021 as a big year for them? Do you feel they have more partnerships and deals to announce coming soon?,self,https://redd.it/kolmzg

Beware!,None,0.75,147,0,3,69,1,Hello all!Let me preface this by saying I wrote this on the options sub first because that's what I enjoy trading  but a lot of what I talk about applied to stocks/shares as well.&#x200B;First off  Happy New Year! It's now 2021! This means there are a lot of people that are wanting to start fresh with new goals  resolutions and getting into new hobbies or interests. If you want to start 2021 with the goal of being financially responsible  want to see if trading in the stock market is your thing  or if you've been doing it and you're just trying to find your way around this crazy mess  then read on!&#x200B;**1. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A MENTOR**\- Be cautious of who you're learning from or where you're putting your trust and money. There are many people that charge outrageous amounts of money to teach you things that you can learn on your own for free. They glamorize this rich lifestyle that they supposedly built from trading or promise you an accelerated path to profit  and now they want to help you do the same. Think about it  if these people were so successful  then why do they need to shove their courses down your throat? I  and a lot of other people  are almost entirely self-taught through reading books  websites and watching YouTube videos. I believe myself to be a self-sufficient trader now. At least for my personal goals  trading style  and expectations. You can learn on your own too  for free 99.&#x200B;**2. I NEVER LOSE. I EITHER WIN  OR I LEARN**\- This journey you're about to start...It's hard. It really is. You're going to encounter many obstacles and experience many pitfalls. You're also going to learn many hard lessons along the way regarding patience  mistakes  risk  and discipline to name a few. You're going to lose money. You're going to feel defeated. You're going to feel like giving up. It's natural. It's human-nature. We've all gone through it. Wanting to give up and quit is especially the case when you lose your hard-earned money. Don't lose hope or give up. Ask anyone how much they lost or how long it took them before they started making money consistently. If they say $0 or not even a few months  they're lying out of their ass. If you win  great! If you lose  learn why you lost. Dig deeper into the reasons and circumstances that led to it. Arguably  you should be tracking your wins and logging that info as well so you can replicate it. I blew up my account twice (about $3500 total) and recovered it all twice (shit gets old quick btw). First from fomo'ing call options on NIO's very first run up when I didn't know about implied volatility (IV) and yolo'ing calls on Rocket's very first earnings because I didn't know that even if expectations are beat  the price direction is still 50/50. Did I feel like quitting? Of course! However  each time I lost big like that I dug into the why's and how's. Coincidentally  if you look at my post history  my very first post (and the most upvoted one) was teaching people how to play NIO's earnings the smarter/safer way. LOL.&#x200B;**3. TRADE WITH FAKE MONEY FIRST (OR DON'T)**\- There's this thing called paper trading where you can try investing/trading without using your hard-earned money. Take advantage of it! I personally didn't and I somewhat regret it. I say somewhat because I believe I would've lost a lot less money than I did while learning. However  the stakes are much higher and I believe it forced me to learn faster. Losing your real money is a whole lot different than losing fake money and affects you much differently.  Use that information how you want to.&#x200B;**4. PLAN YOUR TRADE  TRADE YOUR PLAN**\- This goes a long way. Whenever you're looking at a play. Have a plan to enter  have a plan for the duration you're in the trade  and have a plan to get out of it. Having a plan keeps you consistent. Consistency is the name of the game here. Can you ultimately make money more than you lose it? Having a plan also keeps you out of trouble. For example  one of the biggest pitfalls of trading is trading emotionally. It's almost like when poker players or video gamers tilt. They get nervous  mad  frustrated  scared  pressured  etc and it interferes with their decision-making and thought process. Having a simple plan and following basic rules like not using money you need for bills  or putting all of your money in one trade drastically reduces the risk of getting emotional.&#x200B;**5. SET GOALS. REALISTIC ONES**\- Just like having a plan  setting goals goes a long way. This also helps with staying consistent and building confidence. I have a few friends whose goal is 5-10% of profit each day. Once they make that goal  they're done for the day. Doesn't matter if they cut out too early and it keeps running. They've reached their goal and are fine with that. They do it all over again the next day.&#x200B;**6. FIND YOUR IDEAL TRADING STYLE**\- Day/Scalp traders  swing traders  momentum traders  breakout traders  the list goes on. Each type of trader has their own little nuances and things to pay attention to. For example  a swing trader doesn't really care about intraday price movements as opposed to how much a day trader cares. Or a technical trader doesn't really care about the fundamentals of the company they're trading as opposed to a fundamental trader. Find what style suits your personality and/or what style fits your level of commitment. For example  day trading requires monitoring the market or price action which isn't suitable for someone who works a 9-5 job with meetings all day.&#x200B;**7. WELCOME TO THE RABBITHOLE!**\- Trading requires a certain level of dedication  discipline  and effort to get good at. Do people over in the wallstreetbets sub win money with minimal effort? Yes  they do. But not all the time and is mostly based on luck  thus that strategy isn't sustainable. Learn as much as you can from as many (reputable) sources as possible. Try out what they're teaching  tweak it  fine tune it to how you trade. Even though you've been trading forever and might think you know something  someone else comes along that can do what you do a million times better  faster  and more efficiently. My main point is never stop learning. #StayLearningStayEarning is the motto of my YT channel because although I learned enough to be a self-sufficient trader  I'm still open-minded and make an effort to learn as much as I can. I don't know everything  I'm not perfect  but I definitely want to be better than I was yesterday.&#x200B;**8. WHAT GOES UP (ESPECIALLY IN A VERY SHORT TIME)  MUST COME DOWN**\- Don't get caught in the hype of a certain ticker  especially penny stocks. When people ask me what I think about x company and I look at the chart and see green candles for days going vertical or almost vertical  I tell them it's not worth my time and I personally don't want to trade it. Can you still trade things that run up crazy like that? Of course you can! I've stayed in trades that got me over 100% in profit  but stayed in it because it showed me it wasn't done running yet. However  that's a discussion for another day. But since you're a beginner  I'd strongly advise against it until you  at the very least  start to feel comfortable.&#x200B;That's all I can think of at the moment  but I'm sure that's enough to give you a good foundation. If you have any questions or need help with something  feel free to message or comment. If you did check my post history for that NIO post I referenced back in #2  you'll find that I'm very open to helping. I love helping people with what I know. If you have anything to add to the list that I forgot  by all means  comment them down below to help our new brothers and sisters.Wishing you all a very healthy  happy  and profitable 2021!\-Davin  Edit: Please read the post fully and carefully before starting a riot in the comments. Some people in r/options are arguing points I agree with and talk about in the post or are missing key details. Also  the 5-10% goal per day thing is the goal for the day  on one trade. I'm pointing out that those people I know have small  attainable goals and that's all they shoot for each day.,self,https://redd.it/konayc

Bill Ackman seems to be the man of the year for hedge fund success. Value of his fund is the highest in 2020. I understand that is the value of the holdings of his fund/ company. But how does he pay himself and his employees? Does money for that come from him selling some of his shares  or any other revenue stream (management fees  perhaps)?Thanks in advance for your inputs.

It seems like PDD   JD and baidu are near or at 52 week highs so investors aren’t totally shy about these stocks as they are a more attractive growth story than many large cap American stocks. I can see ant selling off assets and still having a Fintech presence with their holding company functioning as a bank . Right now I’m just valuing Baba as being ANT free and I believe it’s still quite an attractive value . Since Ma is no longer ceo of BABA it seems like the goal was more to penalize jack ma who has more of a symbolic stake in ant. JD is backed by both Google and Walmart  connected with cloud flare and I can’t see it failing  it seems like the best mid to long term growth potential and tencent will slowly grow and is discounted because of BABA as well imo . PDD and BIDU seem quite loved but I’m not really feeling their business models .  Will wallstreet have a short memory once ant is heavily regulated or will caution towards investments in China deepen?,self,https://redd.it/koombh

My understanding is that penny stocks are stocks that trade for $5 or less. I’m curious what people’s thoughts are on penny stocks that graduate to ‘regular’ stocks? For example  if you have shares of a penny stock that ‘graduates’ to a regular stock (above $5)  will you hold onto the shares or sell them as soon as possible? The reason I ask is because I had shares of a penny stock that increased by 9X  I felt this was too good to be true so I sold them but in a short amount of time the stock has doubled since I sold it. Obviously I’m not beating myself up over it as this is probably an outlier but now I’m curious on what you all think when it comes to penny stocks and how you manage them.,self,https://redd.it/kot5br

So for example  you're getting a 3.5% dividend  pay roughly 25% of that to the gov't  and pay 1.59% to the brokerage.3.5% - 0.875% - 1.59% = 1.035% profitAnd this doesn't even factor in potential share appreciation.  Take Coca Cola  for example.  In the past \~60 years I didn't see any dividend cuts.  They currently pay 3% and had you bought in at the pandemic low  you would've locked in a 5.3% dividend.  Or you could've sold for a 50% gain.If you were to have bought in back in 1962  the dividend & split-adjusted rate would be 20 cents per share  and the stock is now trading at $54Going back to 1984  Verizon was $7.34 per share  and is now $58 and pays 4.25%.And if you itemize  you can also deduct your margin expense.So how is it not worth it to borrow at 1.59% and just sit on a quality dividend stock?,self,https://redd.it/kougka

Maybe I will see them answered  or read suggestions / find inspiration.I started investing about three months ago and am currently invested in Vanguard All World  SAP (buying after the dip has worked out well)  ICLN  Nvidia  AMD. I intend to hold all of them long-term with a hopeful profit of over 5%. Nvidia has a bit more room to grow  I hope  given their sales numbers  different tech and ARM acqusition  and I am also hoping for incredible sales numbers of AMD.  I also hold GME because I am an absolute sheep idiot who bought into the hype high; I will probably sell low but am waiting for Jan 11. In the next few days  I want to buy a bit of Microsoft for 2021. Overall  I am looking for a relatively safe return of at least 5 - 10%  ideally a bit more of course. All my stock choices  however  are very tech-oriented. That is because it's the field in which I know most about the companies and their numbers  and also because they've been running well.However  I am very new and none of this of course means that these companies will run well in 2021. If we start seeing a return to normalcy in mid 2021  what are stocks that really benefit from that return to normalcy? I figured Salesforce could be an option because of its dip and them also probably benefiting from overall economic upturn  just like SAP. But that  again  would be tech. I read JPM and on this subreddit a lot  what would be the reasoning here? People are also mentioning Disney: is that because of Disney+ or because of reopening theme parks? So  as you can see  I am open for suggestions. It'd be cool if you could help me out a bit! Thank you in advance.

Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week  and is ready for the new trading week  month and year ahead.Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th  2021.# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)*******> Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind  but already in the dawn of the new year  the market could face its first big challenge.*****> The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday  when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.*****> With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives  Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.*****> The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win  each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.*****> “Georgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years ” said Ed Mills  Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. “It’s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.”*****> Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff  while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election  so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.*****> “It’s a binary event ” said Mills  adding it’s of growing interest to markets. “The general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent  the 2018 election has humbled us … The Senate outcomes  in particular  seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.”*****> Mills said the results may take several days to determine  adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey  88% expect Republicans to maintain control  and most say that is a positive for the stock market.*****> “The market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats ” said Peter Boockvar  chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.*****> “That totally dominates [trading] because it’s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes ” Boockvar said. “I think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending” by Democrats.*****> # By the numbers> A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks  as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&P 500 was up 16.3% for the year  ending at 3 756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year  followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year  and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12 888.*****> Besides the runoff vote  the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week  including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100 000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245 000 jobs created in November.*****> There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday  and a number of Fed speakers  including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.*****> The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.*****> Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed  and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow  and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump’s task force.*****> In that recent RBC survey  three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. “We suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met ” RBC strategists wrote.*****> They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.*****> “This suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point  it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night  closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery ” the strategists noted.*****> Chris Rupkey  chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank  said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden’s presidency.*****> However  Missouri Sen.

It has been a devastating year in so many ways  yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months  with the S&P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far  the best end to a year since WWII.> A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. “Turns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&P 500 the following year every single time since World War II ” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact  January was also higher every single time as well  so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.”> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day  the S&P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile  January was up 5 for 5 as well  rising an impressive 3% on average.> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**> Here’s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again  strong returns are the playbook historically.> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**> We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we’ll see you in 2021!*****> # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days> In a year with some pretty crazy charts  the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year  bot the S&P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right  with just a few hours left in the trading year  the S&P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%  while Long Term US Treasuries  as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd  the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**> The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time  the S&P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year  but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978  there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))*******> # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology> With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020  the S&P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990  the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then  not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years  but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days  they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!> In terms of cumulative returns  the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018  whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years  while the S&P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore  since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**> Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years  there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018  AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly  there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain  but that's because Apple (AAPL)  the sector's largest stock  has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.> On the downside  just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value  while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly  FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%  so depending on how it acts in the next two days  it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))*******> # Growth Dragging on Small Caps> In the past couple of weeks  we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically  taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps  with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks—proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)—are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th  IWO surpassed the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance  and even after pulling back in the past week  IWO is still in the lead.> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**> As a result of recent moves  there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below  we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**> As to just how sharp of a reversal this was  in the five days through yesterday's close  the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that  April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months  but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring  the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011  2008  and a handful of times in the early 2000s.> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**> Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks  small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days  it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**> In the charts below  we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown  the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness  but they have held up significantly better.> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))*******###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))*******Below are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:*****> # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())(NONE.)> # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]())(NONE.)*****> # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))> # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))*****> # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))> # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))*****> # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))> # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))*****> # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** > ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())(NONE.)*****> # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())(NONE.)*****> # Micron Technology  Inc. $75.18**Micron Technology  Inc.

According to a wise man on Wall Street (Warren Buffet) he says all stocks are to regain value in due time  due to supply and demand. Currently there’s A LOT of supply for hotels and services but there is no demand because of lockdowns. What to do with this knowledge? Possibly invest in REITs in long run hoping that people return to hotel and vacation home rentals in the near term future 2-3 years. The expected EPS growth from last year to this current year 2021 is to be 200% greater. However IF traveling and vacations return back to normal this EPS growth could increase by more than 500% according to some analysts.REITs are Investments in companies that own a large sum of hotels  vacation homes  and other travel related luxuries.The commuting stocks have been rebounding as of late as the travel stay related stocks have been lagging. REITs are quite possibly the smartest thing you can invest in for the short term and long term considering many of these companies cannot go lower due to leveraged assets and most of them are debt free.

They had a halt in 2020 sales because of the pandemic  but they still got ARK Invest interest and investment. The x6 growth they had this year got a lot of YouTubers interest  and sort of helped it grows as well  were the reason for me to hesitant investing in the company... until I saw this interview with the CEO (Look on YouTube  I can't post any links)So now  in thinking  wow... this Is a good opportunity.US has been talking about IP stolen by Chinese companies. So more investment in internal R&D trend will start.(once covid pass  this type of R&D is done in person)3D has been on the rise for years and keep going. I'm thinking of custom gamers computer on demand shops.The space industry is exploding  and NNDM printers can work in space!They have requiring revenue from selling materials and services. This is going to keep growing YoY.They have government and private customers.They have over $400M in cash with no debt & just over 50 employees. They don't have competition that as bigas then  and the CEO said they about tobuy them.And my biggest one of all is the YouTube hype on top of all of that  it's like TSLA... so every time they will buy a competitor. ARK will buy. YouTube will report  the market will follow.So I decided to go all-in (well  20% of my portfolio) and buy their stock on Monday.I will have a 30% stop loss to tolerate any major market swings  this is an election year... but also as the max  I'm willing to lose Realistically. I believe they will go to $40 by the end of the year. So about 300% growth.The only downside I have right now is that this will go back to $3 once the hype is over (mainly if they won't buy a competitor in Q1)So Tm here to ask for your opinion. Why shouldn't I buy NNDM?I'm Interest to hear from people who don't own the stock and researched it or if you own it but hesitant to buy more...,self,https://redd.it/kp53l6

I am personally not a fan of buying stocks with loaned money and I would like to bring the following figure about margin debt and market cap of S&P 500 positions to your attention:https://imgur.com/a/FI7eibQOff course the trends in margin might be partially explainable through the total underlying value of the market  albeit flawed as margin does not directly move with stock prices. But I find it a solid point to think twice about the current state of the market and whether to open margins in euphoric trends. This is not to say there is never a place for margins (although limited in my opinion)  nor that a market crash is incoming (I personally think the low interest rate will conti je to be a strong provider for a 2021 bull market)  but I was curious to open the discussion about margin calls.

There is something strange what I can not understand. Unfortunately I can not post a photo here  so I'll try to explain. I would be really thankful  if I could get some explanation. The question is about CureVac (NASDAQ: CVAC) and its stock price in August and September (IPO: 14 August 2020). If I type Curevac stock price in google and look at their char (directly in Google) there is an extreme volatility from August until October. Price was about 6 USD then 40 USD then again low around 1-2 USD at beginning of September then again high to 40 USD then again low  there is about 5-6 jumps and drops until the price fix to around 40 USD in October and then have normal (usual) chart development. (Screenshot would help  but I can not post an image in this sub). If I look on some another websites (ex. Yahoo Finance)  I do not find this volatile period  price chart looks way more normal. Is there any explanation why Google Chart for CVAC Stock price looks so for August and September? Was the price really so volatile?Thank You in andvance.

I thought Beyond was an exciting company  and an interesting stock  and I had just seen the stock price drop after they reported Q3 earnings. But I hadn’t decided to buy the stock  and it looked like FEJ had and he got in at about the bottom after earnings. “He’s a genius!” I thought… So I liked his bull thesis  I added it to my watchlist  and I watched and watched and watched… and finally on a day it pulled back like 5% I got in! I was going to start building my position. And then it kept dropping. And on another day it finally got back to the price that FEJ had gotten it  so I doubled down! But then I started getting nervous. Why had they missed earnings? What reasons did they give? FEJ didn’t even talk about it in his video. Well I checked out their last conference call  every publicly traded company gives out a summary of their finances every quarter and holds a question and answer session on a call. And then I found out. They missed huge. And the reasons they gave… because of “freezer stuffing” (I’m paraphrasing)  during the grocery panic in Q2 related to Covid… customers didn’t buy as much in Q3  because they had already bought so much and they were storing it. Okay… Oh  and the reason that they didn’t “participate” in takeout was because restaurants had slimmed down their menus and didn’t include their products. Okay… Oh and they declined to issue guidance for Q4. So on the call you’ll see every time an analyst asks if they see their situation improving they would just reply “we are not issuing guidance at this time.” And then finally  there is this whole thing going on w/ McDonald’s  where they’re debuting the “McPlant.” Which was maybe a collaboration with Beyond  but they’re not publicly saying it… and Beyond wants their brand represented on the menu but McDonalds won’t even confirm that they are partnering with them  only that they had helped them test products at some point blah blah blah. So after learning all of this I thought it was pretty disingenuous of FEJ to not disclose these details in his video. To me it means that uncertainty and risk in Beyond stock is HIGH AF rn. Fortune favors the brave  so if you’re entering here and they turn things around  I think you could build a kick-ass position. But you need a reason to be faithful. Why do you think they’re going to turn it around in the near term? Because if they miss again  that stock price is going to fall again hard. Not to mention  you look at their financials and they are not currently profitable  and the stock is already being given a generous price multiple  etc. And finally  I was low on cash. And $BYND looks thirsty. IMO if you’re going to enter a risky stock  you gotta be ready to average down. You gotta have water. If you got no water then what you really want in the stock market is a cactus 🌵. So I’m out of $BYND stock for now. I also go out of $ABNB for similar reasons on the same day. Both interesting stocks and interesting companies and I hope to get back in at a later date.

Valuations continue to be sky high without any meaningful pullback  which was a large concern even in 2019. Sectors such as Clean Energy have seen huge run ups in anticipation of a friendlier government  but it remains to be seen how easy it will be for those companies to deliver those expectations. Genomics has seen a recent surge in popularity  however the timeframe for widespread adoption is still way off into the future.

Moving on to year 2,Discussion,0.76,17,0,1,10,0,  **Okay  but where do I start?***I was asking myself this same question only 10 months ago. So  do not automatically assume that you are laps behind. For the past ten years  I focused on just allocating a portion of each paycheck towards my retirement account. I focused on keeping it simple and stuck to low-cost index funds. Mostly  because I am unable to invest in individual stocks in my government retirement account. With that said  low-cost index funds are the most assured way to secure a nice retirement. The only thing you need is a few decades of continued contributions and growth. I found myself wanting something else though. I did not want to wait to retire in my sixties.**This is where I shifted my goals a bit. I wanted to focus on building up an investment portfolio  which I could access at any time. I opened a brokerage account so I could eventually live off it  much like my 401K  but could start relying on 20 years earlier. I still contribute to my 401k  but the goal is to not need it.***Road Map:** *You must be ready to change your beliefs. There are endless of ways to invest and many of those ways can be the right way.* **How I currently see my investment road map is this:***Next 12 years invest in companies that:*&#x200B;* *Small to medium market cap** *Very high growth** *Software as a Service modeled company**From years 12-15 transition in companies that:*&#x200B;* *Medium to large market cap** *Dividend companies or ** *High growth*This map could easily change  based on too many factors to count. Instead of the next 12 years  I could keep my approach now well into the future. I could end up being burned by one too many companies and grow to be more conservative. You just must be willing to adapt.***Philosophy:*****How many companies?***There is no golden rule I follow when it comes to the number of companies  I hold at one point in time. I try to stick somewhere between 15-25  because it is easier for me to really keep up with these companies from top to bottom at this amount.***Ideal market cap?***Less than 25 Billion is where I would like to be for each holding. Typically  I focus on companies in the single-digit billions  but if a company continues to grow at a high rate  I stay in my position until the revenue growth declines by a reasonable amount.***What type of companies?**C*loud based subscription modeled companies. This means that the company is usually a SaaS one. Software as a Service (SaaS). They offer small  medium  large  and enterprise customers certain services on a subscription model. The stickier the service the better. If the type of service is one that becomes hard to live without  the company can sell additional add-ons and improvements to the company. The subscriptions are usually done annual  so it is easy to see revenue floor of the companies. So  the growth would be accelerated by the additional new customers that are brought in.**I also do not mind e-commerce companies (Shopify  Etsy  Pinterest  etc.) and sometimes a bio tech company here and there.*How long do I hold a company?*It is quite flexible  but If I see two consecutive quarters of growth declined earnings… I put my money to work in a better vehicle.***Building the portfolio:** *I originally started with 10 companies and made them all 10% each of my portfolio. I felt that it was straight forward and that the cream would rise to the top and make up a larger percentage of my holdings. My beginning balance was no great amount  either.*    *The companies were:*1. The Trade Desk2. Etsy3. Datadog4. Fastly5. Alteryx6. Crowdstrike7. Roku8. Appian9. Elastic10. Zoom*I still own all of these companies  aside from Alteryx. I put very little more into any of these companies. I want to make the company do the hard work. I want their performance to grow my account… not more of my own money. I only add more money to accounts when I see a large collapse of share price for no fault of the company (Covid).***New companies?***For new companies  I limit the size of the position to 1-3% of my portfolio’s current size. Overtime they will grow and be worth more than that percentage of my portfolio and if not  the risk was minimized  and I move on. I do not focus on share price because these are typically small cap companies with large runways and just because something is 900 dollars a share  does not mean it cannot hit 3000 dollars a share.***How year 1 ended?** [https://imgur.com/gallery/KVNCZZV](https://imgur.com/gallery/KVNCZZV)Above is my portfolio from my first year with this strategy. I am currently holding **17** companies with just have added MGNI on the 31st of December. I will probably add 3 more companies and sit at 20 for this year. A few companies I am looking at?

I've managed to collect over 8 months of minute data for the S&P100 to test against and was originally averaging the profit percent of each ticket. This was a horrible way to measure it and lead to all kinds of errors. From there I learned about APPT (average profitability per trade). I averaged the wins  losses  and profits from all the tickers before calculating it  but even then I'm not sure what a successful value should be (other than +good  -bad). Using a $100k initial investment I was able to make 70k trades with an APPT of $25. The W/L ratio was 3:1. I was also able to tweak my strategy to make 30k trades at $20 APPT and the same initial investment and W/L of 3:1. Is the second strategy better because even though it has a lower APPT but the number of trades is cut in half? This could mean more simultaneously trades assuming the right conditions are met?What is consider a good APPT value and what other success measurements do you all use?Note: My 70k and 30k trades are assuming I could make every possible trade across all 143 tickers. I would at best only be able to combine a hand full at a time (averaging ~500 trades per ticker).,self,https://redd.it/kpbags

Bullish on these tickers but given the number of positions in the portfolio I only have a cursory understanding of those businesses so I'm trying to trim the number of stocks I own - going for quality over quantity. This portfolio beats the SP when I backtested my purchases using SP instead of these tickers but maybe I can do better if I get rid of the gain diluting stocks? Are these too speculative given I don't have ETFs? Looking for suggestions on what should go and feel free to suggest other positions not on this list that may be better than some of the positions I already have for long term growth. Looking for more genomics exposure as well (maybe ARGK but not a fan of higher expense ratios). Plan is to buy and hold over the next few years.

I am planning on investing in Brookfield Renewable & Brookfield Infrastructure stocks for the long term. However  the recent share splits made me confused. See  BIPC is outperforming BIP  and BEPC is outperforming BEP. Meanwhile  the dividend yield is higher for the partnerships than the C-corps.I'm confused as to which stock to buy. Aren't the two stocks supposed to be equivalent? Why do they have such different performance? I don't want to buy the C-corp and have a risk of valuation (since it is more overvalued than the partnership)I also don't want to buy the partnership and miss out on future gains  since the C-corp seems to be more popular..Could someone clarify for me as to which stock should I buy?Because quite honestly  I'm thinking about avoiding all of Brookfield's stocks because of all the confusion.Thanks in advance,self,https://redd.it/kpf2b1

Doing a bit more research  I saw that they recently filed for a patent on 12/31 for “Treatment with ajulemic acid that results in a dose-dependent decrease in the occurrence of acute pulmonary exacerbations requiring treatment with intravenous antibiotics when compared to placebo. A 75% reduction was observed in the 48 week rate of acute pulmonary exacerbations in subjects treated with ajulemic acid at 20mg BID”My question: How often do pharmaceutical companies file patents like this and is this something that’s worth having high hopes for? I’m assuming this happens all the time in the industry and I know it’s just them filing an application (rather than getting it approved) but I was curious to hear any other investors’ opinions on how much weight they put into news like this and what other aspects on pharma related companies they look for? I usually just invest in the MJ sector and am pretty new to this sector. I think it’s worth noting that this company is studying cannabinoids and is the reason I came across it as well lol. Also  their pipeline of new drugs is pretty small right now which I know is not good/ideal but figured I’d take a look and see what y’all thought!Thank you all in advance and all opinions are welcome!

I learned about NIO over two years ago when they were featured on 60 Minutes and was one of the first active users on r/Nio. Back then  the stock was 10$  and I bought 500 shares. But after their IPO  they had a rough year with declining sales. Despite that  I kept buying in to eventually accumulate 3 200 shares at an average price of 3.12$.But then came more bad news and worse sales. People were talking about the company running out of cash and the stock going to 0$  and they did eventually hit 1.00$. I sold at 1.78$ before that happened and took my 57% loss.I've only been investing for two years  but it's my biggest regret so far. I should have never listened to some asshole at Bloomberg getting paid to write negative articles and trusted my gut. NIO is a solid company and is going to be one the leaders in the Chinese and global EV market. They completely restructured after those losses (Nio Places vs. Nio Houses  fired staff  etc.)  and those 3 200 shares are worth over 150 000$ today. They'll be worth even more in the future.All I can do now is take this as a learning experience  but I feel like I'll never find another stock like it.

Could this be really bad for the stock (i.e. could it drop to levels below the pre-acquisition announcement) if the investigations uncover something?Personally  I think the acquisition price of $3.50/share is too low when compared to where RLH has been in non-recession times.  Historically (over 23 years)  RLH has generally traded above $5 a share  except in the 2008 recession  and this COVID-19 recession. Granted  there had been financial turmoil within RLH in the few of months leading up to the pandemic (which resulted in the ouster of its CEO)  but it seems like the board is just throwing in the towel at this point and not patient enough to see its turnaround strategy be implemented and in action post-pandemic.* Acquisition announcement: [https://ir.redlion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/rlh-corporation-announces-agreement-be-acquired-sonesta](https://ir.redlion.com/news-releases/news-release-details/rlh-corporation-announces-agreement-be-acquired-sonesta)* Halper Sadeh LLP investigation: [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201231005161/en/RLH-Merger-Investigation-Halper-Sadeh-LLP-Announces-Investigation-Into-Whether-the-Sale-of-Red-Lion-Hotels-Corporation-Is-Fair-to-Shareholders-Investors-Are-Encouraged-to-Contact-the-Firm-%E2%80%93-RLH](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201231005161/en/RLH-Merger-Investigation-Halper-Sadeh-LLP-Announces-Investigation-Into-Whether-the-Sale-of-Red-Lion-Hotels-Corporation-Is-Fair-to-Shareholders-Investors-Are-Encouraged-to-Contact-the-Firm-%E2%80%93-RLH)* Weiss Law LLP investigation: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shareholder-alert-weisslaw-llp-investigates-red-lion-hotels-corporation-301199805.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shareholder-alert-weisslaw-llp-investigates-red-lion-hotels-corporation-301199805.html),self,https://redd.it/kprqon

I personally see that as a safer bet than investing directly into EV and solar companies that are more dependent on innovative tech. What do y’all think?,self,https://redd.it/kps9ov

If you think it's useless down vote it and I will delete it.At the beginning of 2020 I was just like most of you was not a member of WSBs and invested on my own accord. All that changed in February. I opened an active trading account for fun. I joined reddit and figured I should get involved with the community so that we make money together. Here are the lessons that I think would help some of newer guys than me. Also here is my performance in my speculative account which was opened in March 2020: \[Apparently I can't post screen shot here. I've the screenshot posted on my profile\] **Lesson 1: Consistency Matters**My goal with this speculative account was to try different strategies but get consistent returns nonetheless. I aimed to not have any down months. This helps alleviate the mental anguish caused by roller-coaster-type portfolios. As my mama told me 5 years ago  you are playing with hard-earned-money. This is why I stayed away from YOLOing the whole account on few select plays. I aimed to have many different bets going on at the same time.**Lesson 2: Helping others is harder than earning money.**My dad opened a speculation account at the same in March. I decided that I would help him have a similar performance as mine. I kept on feeding him info about my trades. What did he do? Most of the times he thought I was retarded and called the local hospital for me. When Boeing dropped to $93  I was on the phone telling him this is free money. I told him to by $30k but he just bought $10k. I was buying American Airlines on the same day. This story repeated many times over the last 9 month. I think at the end he managed to scratch of \~250%. Now I have him on a conservative buy and hold strategy since he is not cut out to actively trade. And by actively I mean 4 trades a week for him.**Lesson 3: Having a good broker is important**If you haven't deleted R0binh00d and gotten your self a proper broker after you hearing or experiencing bugs  crashes  service outages  your data being sold  .... then I don't know if I can convince you. Other brokers will give you access to ADRs and allow you invest in some bigger European companies that are trading OTC here.**Lesson 4: Don't argue with people; instead discuss ideas.**If you notice someone is arguing instead of discussing ideas with you then just ignore them. For every seller of a stock there is a buyer. There is no point in personally attacking people. If you believe strongly that they are wrong  then just inverse their trade. Respect and thank them for sharing their trades with you  even if you disagree with them.**Lesson 5: Media is a hype machine**CNBC  Bloomberg  ... are all in the business of creating excitement and increasing their viewership. They are not there to enhance your returns. What gets people's attention is usually not a good investment.**Lesson 6: Reddit slaps you harder than a twisted tea**I used to share ALL my DDs here. Sharing is caring  right? apparently not. There was no shortage of personal attacks  being banned  DDs being deleted  ... My Karma even dropped to -1k in March. I am permanently banned from r/ investing  economics  .... I got temporary banned here  and two other investing subs. So I post less DDs now  and don't try to stop people from jumping from rooftops.**Lesson 7: Most popular posts/users should not be blindly mimicked**Most people including me already know this  but I keep seeing it here. I figured I should mention it since I have your attention. When you see a trade that is getting a lot of attention ask yourself: does this fit my strategy? If not then don't do it. What is strategy you ask? oh boy**Lesson 8: Don't let survivor bias fool you**Everyday people on WSB are throwing millions of dollars on thousands of small bets. The odds are some of them are gonna pay of. So when you see some guy posting Gain-porn of 1k turning to 100k overnight. Remember that over night thousands of other people with similar bets lost it all. So don't just follow people blindly. Some of the most respected guys here are essentially doing the same thing by YOLOing all their money on one bet that unfolds over several month. These guys last longer but essentially are playing few bets game. When you roll the dice 5 times the odds of you getting 5 in a row is a lot. There is a reason we don't hear from YungBillionaire anymore. Please don't Yolo your whole account on GME  Palantir  and such.**Lesson 9: Reddit is skews the information you see**Not all the best ideas are popular and not all the popular ideas are good. lol**Lesson 10: When the tide goes out you realize who was swimming naked.**Popularized by WB  he wasn't the one who came up with it. When a correction happens  and I guarantee you there will be a correction  then you realize who was blindly chasing alpha without any risk management. The correction may not come for a few years but there always is a correction  pullback for some random reason. So **manage your risk.** Guh**Lesson 11: unless you have insider info do not buy weekly or even monthly options.**LEAPs are risky as well but can be managed. Most people here should not take the weekly or monthly option risk. You need years of experience before doing so.**Lesson 12: Paper accounts don't count.**You need real money to be at risk so that you care and go through the emotions. I never had a paper account and if you are using one  in my opinion you are wasting your time.**Lesson 13: No one has a magic sauce.**Those who pretend to do are delusional. There is no such thing as always do this and you will win. Market changes and strategies that work now will not work in 2 month. If a guru says buy x  y and z and you will make money  that's total BS.**Lesson 14: If you get money help yourself and your family**You have the option Yoloing your money on weeklys  buy coke  or elevating your life. Money truly brings happiness. Only people who don't have it think that it does not; and site a bs study. Use your money to help your family at key points in their lives. Help with their Mortgage down payment  buy a car for the ones who really need them ... Use your money to work less and work out more. Yolo in real life  not on options.**Lesson 15: If you don't invest with conviction  you won't get the results that matter**You have to know why you are buying some stock and why you would sell it. A lot of winning trades will go against you before they go green. To hold those positions when deep in the red  you gotta have conviction in your thesis.I am not going to edit this post because it will mess up it's format. I am going to put a comment below with updates/corrections. Also do NOT message me personally. I don't have a magic sauce.,self,https://redd.it/kptkw2

Potential entry point when Aroon Up crosses Aroon Down.* Based on the Bollinger Band analysis  the stock is overbought because the price line is very close to the upper band. Also  the upper and lower bands are creating “The Squeeze” situation  indicating that a potential increase in volatility is likely (No time frame given from this indication).

Obviously with power shifting in America to a president elect who seems to be a bit tougher on the stock market and its gains  and with virus cases rising astronomically and many states threatening a shutdown again  the market could see a substantial fall.

I'm talking about the analysts for the traditional investment portfolios. To me  they seem to be overthinking everything  overanalyzing every little detail. This has lead to an ultra conservative investment mindset where they shun a lot of really good stocks that could have netted them good profits. I'm not a professional. I wouldn't even say I know a lot about stocks. I know the basics like company financials  revenue  net profit  book value  cash flow  debt  eps  p/e ratio etc. Most of the time  I don't even read quarterly earnings reports. I read them when I'm bored. I mainly just read seeking alpha articles and their comment section. But  for some reason  I'm out performing these traditional wall street analysts.

Apple has picked them for their newest 5G phoneThe modem  not the processor. Apple's processors are still competitive with Qualcomm's Snapdragons  but it's quite close.https://www.macrumors.com/guide/5g-iphone/2. Google Pixels have been using them for years and that likely isn't going to change (at least I think so). They're also in Google's newest 5G phone.It's possible Google could move to making their own processors to lower costs for their cell phone line  but I don't see them pulling the trigger on it. The market for processors is highly competitive and they're already joining the Video Game market which is much  MUCH bigger.3. 5G modems will be needed for EV cars. EVs function off a computer system to do their self driving thing. They require constant updates with big downloads. 5G will give them a significantly faster download speed and faster GPS functionality.4. Verizon (the biggest phone company in the US) requires them). Samsung makes their S20 with both Qualcomm and their own  in-house processors as well for this very reason.https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s20-snapdragon-865-vs-exynos-990DISCLOSER: I am investing in the company as of this coming Monday (I have a limit buy set).

My thoughts are  bottom line  studios need the movie theater revenue stream or tentpole movies/franchises will cease to exist. Also  I don’t think streaming will have a huge impact on theaters in the long run. Streaming is quickly becoming more popular  yes  and subscribers are growing. But theaters hold a lot of leverage  so there will be at least a month of run in the theater for a particular wide release  when things return to normal  before a movie reaches its parent streaming platform. I think the day-and-date stunt Warners/HBO Max pulled will disappear after this year  and maybe even by this summer.Therefore  with vaccines on target to be widely distributed by April  the first summer blockbusters are back in theaters beginning in May 2021... is bankruptcy for AMC actually likely between now and May?

New discovery+ channel is also launching on Roku (along with Amazon fire). IMO I think Roku and Quibi are a perfect fit - one of the biggest complaints with Quibi was it being mobile-only and expensive  both problems which Roku can solve.The short-form content will serve as great free content on the Roku Channel while also driving subscriptions to other channels through Roku (the Roku Channel is one of the fastest growing channels but it's primary purpose is to sell content from other providers for recurring revenue). Thoughts? I think this is definitely a positive for the rapidly growing company and the stock may move up on the expectation that Roku could start dabbling in content creation as it begins to turn revenue-positive.,self,https://redd.it/kq49mr

If we're counting by households (128mil)  then if your household gained $30k in 2020 from stock market  your household got their share.In reality  since 10% of households own 80% of stocks  if you're a top 10% household  gaining $237k would be your household share.If you're not the top 10%  gaining $6.6k would be your household share.,self,https://redd.it/kq4nrs

I'm based in the UK  and use Hargreaves Lansdown (an online broker) to invest in a bunch of stocks that interest me.  Mainly US stocks and funds  but there are some others.  I currently use Morning Star to track my portfolio  as it tracks everything I throw at it  but don't particularly enjoy the clunky experience or lack of mobile app.  I like Yahoo Finance  but it doesn't recognise a number of international funds. e.g. [Fidelity Global Technology](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/funds/snapshot/snapshot.aspx?id=F00000SX2A)  [ShareSight](https://www.sharesight.com/uk/) is also excellent and I really liked using it  because it does a lot as well as calculate my tax burdens  but it doesn't track non-UK or non-US domiciled stocks. Meaning anything with an ISIN that doesn't begin UK/US.

I downloaded return data from FactSet  and even though everything else seems normal  I find that about 1% of the IPO’s from the whole data set that I checked had something ridiculous marked as their first day return after their IPO’s  i.e. +20000%  +100000% etc. Anyone know why? I’m looking at this from a theoretical POV  but couldn’t find anything from google or even from specific company stock price information. After the first day return however (1-week return  1-month return etc.) everything seemed more balanced out and the returns were not irrational.Some sort of explanation for this would be amazing!

It may also give us an opportunity to reflect on our investing journeys and consider a change in approach.  So... for those interested in making the shift to investing  what does it mean to be a long-term investor?  To me it's about being prepared enough so that I don't have to worry about the day-to-day.To think of an analogy... It's like the student who studies and does his/her homework the night before and has nothing to worry about the next day.  Sometimes  you did all the work for nothing  especially when the teacher doesn't check your work (think of this as the red day after you making an investment decision).  Sometimes you are rewarded immediately.  However  at the end of the day  the student who does his/her homework every night will have less to worry about when it comes to the final exam.  Similarly  when it comes to long-term investing  by doing your research and coming up with a plan  you don't have to worry or stress out as much about your ultimate success.Note  that  at the end of the day  long-term investing is just one of many options to get involved in the market.  You can be just as successful  if not more  by day trading or swing trading  etc.  Just know that the path you choose requires a different mindset/approach to the market.  So how does it work?  I wanted to share with you some big themes to keep in mind as you being your long-term investing journey.1. **Find your WHY.** First and foremost  it's important to figure out who you are and why you are investing.  What is your risk tolerance?  Do you consider yourself to be more aggressive?  How much time do you have?  How do you want to spend your time?  To dig deeper and get a sense of your risk tolerance:  What is your financial outlook?  Do you expect to need money now or expect an uptick in monthly expenses?  Do you have a stable income?  Who do your loved ones turn to when there is an emergency?  What are your investing goals?  When do you want to retire? When do you expect to get married?  When do you want to start a family?  etc.  All these questions  from the day-to-day to the big picture are important to consider when deciding to be a long-term investor.  This should inform how you approach the markets  and what weight you should give certain stocks.  Finding your WHY is an important first step in determining how to approach the markets.  2. **What are the MACROTRENDS?** When deciding to pick a stock  I like to first think about macrotrends.  Where do you see the world heading?  How do you think consumer behavior will change?  How do you think industries will change?  What impact will politics  international relations  and global and domestic issues have on the economy and the markets?  This requires staying informed about the world to a certain degree  but it's generally a great way to start thinking proactively about the markets and  also  to just become a more well-rounded individual.  3. **Does the company have a MOAT?**  So you thought of some macrotrends  and you identified an industry you want to invest in.  You pick out a stock.  Ask yourself  does the company have a moat.  A moat is essentially something that allows the company to standout from its competitors.  It can be anything.  It can be the brand name  it can be user experience  it can be expected market share  it can even be the leadership or CEO  or all of the above.  Essentially  does the company have something about it that convinces you that it will stick around  successfully so  5+ years from now?  As a long-term investor  I always seek to identify moats.  It will take some of the stress out of my decision-making because I am confident that the company will last.  4. **Are you comfortable with the FINANCIALS?** I don't necessarily find it super helpful to focus in on certain numbers over others  etc.  However  you should have SOME understanding of the company's financials.  For example  I don't think you necessarily have to look for profitability.  Some great companies with solid moats operate at a loss.  Why?  Because they are investing in their growth.  But some companies operate at a loss because  well  they're just losing companies  or the greater industry itself is just falling apart and investors are getting out (i.e. oil).  Or maybe  the company isn't operating efficiently and the company is taking on more debt than it is producing revenue.  Just have a general understanding of why the way things are and how they might be moving forward  that should be enough to get you started.  5. **Be STINGY:  Is the price right for you?** At the end of the day  you have to make the ultimate  probably most important decision:  is the price right for you?  Understand the basics of the stock market:  essentially  it is a salesperson making a pitch to sell a piece of a company at a certain price.  Hey  you want to buy a piece of Apple for $130?  Granted  in real-time you are being approached by hundreds of salesman on any given hour:  Ok  what about $129?  Oh  lost your chance  now we can only sell it for 134.  When you go to the store looking for a particular product  you already have a price in mind.  Salespeople might come up to you and offer you a wide range of prices for that product  but there is a range that you will consider.  Anything too cheap will make you skeptical of its quality.  Anything too expensive will be considered a rip-off.  Humanizing the market in this way will help you become a steadier investor.  **Is the stock worth X dollar amount to you?** If so  great.  Pull the trigger and invest.  If it goes down the next day  you don't have to worry because based on your research  you believe that the stock will come up and reach whatever dollar amount you think it's worth.  If not  then wait or don't buy it.  There are thousands of companies reaching out to you to buy their company at a certain price--there are always other opportunities.  6. **Stay informed.**  Once you choose your stocks  you need to stay informed.  This can be a lot of things and it can be done in a lot of ways.  But  at the end of the day  you need some pulse on what you invest in.  Keep in mind the identifying reasons for why you invested in certain things  and be prepared to reconsider or reflect on your choices as soon as those reasons change.  For some companies  it might be easy.  Perhaps the MOAT you identified for one company is the CEO.  Great.  That means  as soon as you see news about leadership changing in that company  you need to reconsider your position in the stock.  You don't have to freak out daily. Macrotrends and moats and financials don't change overnight.  You're really looking for a trend overtime.  A weekly / biweekly / monthly routine can suffice.  7. **Be as disciplined as possible**.  All of the above factors above ultimately help you to do ONE thing as a long-term investor.  To stay disciplined.  You want to take the emotions out of investing because as a long-term investor your outlook is not next week  next month  or next year.  Your outlook is the next 5 years  the next 10 years  etc.  Don't FOMO into a stock; instead  think about why it's spiking and go through steps 1-5  especially step 5.  Don't sell right away just because the stock you chose dipped 10% based on a piece of bad news; instead  think about why it's dipping and go through steps 1-5.  You get the gist.  As long-term investors we should be thinking big picture.  If steps 1-5 haven't changed after 1 piece of bad news  a 10% dip can be a great buying opportunity.  Alternatively  if steps 1-5 haven't changed after a stock shoots up an insane amount  it may be an opportunity to lock in some profits.Keeping these points in mind should help you get started as a long-term investor.  Would be happy to chat with anyone about their own journeys or just to discuss!  Best of luck to all as we enter 2021!,self,https://redd.it/kq88x0

Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers  let’s talk about this & other stock market news**Hello everyone and Good Morning! So  let’s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020  as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs  while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day  gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day  but it’s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago  as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.We just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs  as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities  Financials  Real Estate & Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  We also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%  as you can see in Thursday’s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board  while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil & Gas industry.Here is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba  Shopify  Palantir  Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers  while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here  while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month  with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.We also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here  led by Technology  Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well  except the Financial  Travel and Energy sectors  which finished the year down.The biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival  OXY  Norwegian Cruise Line  United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn’t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020  having the best gains in 11years  with companies like Walgreens  Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%  while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing  Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.We also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020  as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple  Nvidia  PayPal  Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna  Peloton & Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple & Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike  Disney & Salesforce.We also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau’s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery  but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December  which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.Meanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X)  which dipped below 800K again  19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected  as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).While this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains  or if the results and data don’t show up as investors & analysts expected it  we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction  which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.We also really don’t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week  with most of the interesting ones like Micron  Walgreens & Bed Bath & Beyond coming on Thursday.So  in some other stock market news  Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter  as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world’s biggest car market  as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock  check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kci399/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).Some other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December  while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K  up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries  which were also up over 110% year/year  as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.Meanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement  pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO  as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock  despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers  less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm  Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company  and I really like what they are doing  so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.Guys  personally I can’t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand  but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations  as this could impact the Apple revenue stream  this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kmp7x1/apple_aapl_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/)We also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA’s CEO  as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring  as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.Meanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired  more than tripling the shares float.And on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi  this would give a boost to Roku’s exclusive programming  as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open  with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning  while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.Thank you everyone for reading!

kq8klv,cpa_for_the_people_,2021-01-04 13:17:30,2021-02-03 21:17:53,1970-01-01 00:00:00,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,Deep Dive Research About a Collaborative Work Management Company Poised to Benefit off the Remote Work Trend. NYSE Listed.,None,0.5,0,0,0,0,0,**TL:DR is at the bottom**Hello  welcome to my second deep dive write up.My  name’s Mark and I’m an accountant with a passion for investing. About  two years ago  I used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm  and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and  privately held companies in the U.S. My goal is to bring my unique  perspective from that past experience  my current experience working in a  new role at a large corporation  and my understanding of accounting to  help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market  today.I’m a long-term investor. I  am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time.  I’m willing to endure volatility  crazy price drops  and everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. If you  want to learn more about this approach. I recommend reading the book  “100 Baggers” by Chris Mayer.**Introduction**I’m  excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month  Smartsheet.  I’m always looking for investment ideas. I run stock screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth)  scan Twitter   talk to professionals in different industries  and try to observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. One  of the best investment decisions I’ve made to date came after I talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. Shout out  to you Celsius (CELH)! With that being said  you never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.In  the case of Smartsheet  I became aware of the company through a stock  screener. I was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6B)  strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%)  and the fact that it’s a subscription  business model (SaaS). Once I became aware of these facts  it cued me to  take a deeper dive. The more I learned about Smartsheet  the more I  liked. Management talks a lot about empowering people and that really  struck a chord with me. In different roles I’ve had as a teacher  tutor   and supervisor  I’ve always found empowering people to be one of the  most important keys to success. I will touch on this more later in the  write up.Another positive signal I  got about Smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. I was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. I was watching an  interview on my phone with Mark Mader  the CEO of Smartsheet. My  girlfriend overheard the word “Smartsheet” mentioned in the video and  said “Are they talking about the Smartsheet with the blue check mark?”. I  had to Google their logo but yes  it turns out we were thinking about  the same Smartsheet. I asked her how she knew about it. She said “My  company just transitioned all of our work onto Smartsheet. I really love  it. Our marketing department is really excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” Hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about Smartsheet.**The Thesis Statement**For  every stock pick I make  I want to provide a quick thesis statement  that can serve as a reminder for why I’m buying and holding that stock  for the long term. I’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long  so it can easily be remembered and internalized. This helps during times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why  you’re holding this position.The thesis statement I have come up with for Smartsheet is as follows:*“Smartsheet:  A leader in collaborative work management (CWM) software. As the global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work  managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their  teams  projects and deadlines. Smartsheet is that tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of  their teams.”*I think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what Smartsheet does. If  you go to Smartsheet’s website and look at the “About” page  you will  find their “About” statement which says “Smartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your  entire business can move faster  drive innovation  and achieve more.”  Notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster   drive innovation  and achieve more.In  my thesis statement  I mention that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM  software space. But how do I know this? Well  a highly reputable  independent research firm named Forrester conducted a study on the CWM  space based off different criteria including collaboration  enterprise  capabilities  UI/user experience  planned enhancements and number of  customers just to name a few of the factors considered. I put the  companies that were identified from the study in the order of their  ranking below. As you can see  Smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader  in the space at 2nd place. Let’s use our common sense for a second. At  the beginning stages of a remote work revolution  do we want to invest  in an up and coming SaaS company that focuses on providing firms with  resources to digitally manage their teams  digitally manage  work/projects  and digitally collaborate to get work done? I think the  answer should be a resounding yes. But what about these other companies  on the list. Let’s break them down 1 by 1:* Workfront  was recently bought by Adobe. If you want to invest in Workfront  you’d  have to invest in the much larger company of Adobe. It wouldn’t be a  pure play investment into the CWM space.* Smartsheet is 2nd and of course  they are public :)* Wrike is private* ServiceNow  – CWM is just one small piece of their total      offerings. Investing  here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.  Also  the company is  already quite large ($106B market cap)* Asana  is public but just IPO’d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. We don’t have  much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.  Furthermore  although they actually would be a pure play investment into  the CWM space  they’re not a leader and rank behind Smartsheet in  several of Forrester’s categories. Why invest in the 2nd best when you  can invest in the best?* Monday.com is private* Microsoft – CWM is just one small piece of their total offerings. Investing here would not be a pure play into the CWM space.* Atlassian  – This company does primarily focus on CWM but I have a couple problems  with them as an investment. 1) They’re ranked way beneath Smartsheet.  2) They’re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x  (market cap already $58B).Now  that we’ve established that Smartsheet is a leader in the CWM space and  that they’re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment  in this space let’s understand why this is important. Other than the  obvious reason that we’re in the beginning stages of a remote work  revolution  why is this important?Well   let’s take a look at this quote from Mark Mader  Smartsheet CEO  during  the last earnings call (Q3 FY21) that occurred on December 7th  2020:“Leaders  are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work   work that is documented  automated  tracked with dashboards  and where  priorities are clearly defined. They understand that by empowering their  teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work  cycle  times will be improved  a deeper sense of ownership will be created  and  prioritization and accountability will be insured. Smartsheet is  ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive  the benefits from doing so.”Key word here: Asynchronous. Asynchronous communication is different from Synchronous communication. Here is the difference:Asynchronous: email  message boards  dashboards  etc.Synchronous: video conferencing  chat  audio calls  etc.Any  communication that doesn’t require a real-time response can be  considered asynchronous  like the examples in the picture above.  Synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real  time  thereby allowing for immediate responses  see examples above. As  part of my research on Smartsheet  I read an E-Book that was written by  the original co-founders of Smartsheet  Mark Mader the current CEO and  Brent Frei who is no longer with the company. They wrote the E-Book in  2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. The E-Book is  called “The Power of Done”. The moral of the book is that Mark and Brent  noticed through their own experience  and through different research  studies on work place productivity  that the rise in technology in the  early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. This  is a quote from their E-Book:“According  to Basex  a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy   interruptions from email  cell phones  instant messaging  text messaging  and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis   this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire U.S.  workforce  or a $588 billion cost to the American economy.”They  mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in  work technology such as email  word processing  and spreadsheets  there  hadn’t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork  collaboration or task management. The fact that technology advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred  productivity at the same time is what Mark and Brent referred to as the  productivity paradox. They wanted to do something about it and thus they  founded Smartsheet.**How Smartsheet makes money**At  the very least  before you invest in a company  you better understand  how they make money. In Chris Mayers’ excellent book  100 Baggers  that I  mentioned above  he continually references top line revenue growth as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 Bagger. This isn’t  to tell you that any stock I pick will be a 100 Bagger just because it  has great top line revenue growth  but if I am looking at a growth stock  to hold for the long term  revenue growth is one of the first things I  look at.Before I talk about the  revenue streams of Smartsheet  I want to share a little bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. Co-Founder/CEO Mark  Mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done  on spreadsheets such as Microsoft Excel. However  he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full  potential. He wanted to help people get more out of their use of  spreadsheets. As a result  we now have Smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no  matter where they are with live information about project statuses   meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. Users can choose their way of viewing this information with  different views such as calendar view  grid view  card view  and Gantt  view.The idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information  available to all members of a team about the status of a project  the  tasks assigned  and the timelines  the less synchronous communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what  they’re hired to do – get work done. Think about how wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down  to see where they’re at with their assignments. What if all this  information was available for him  his managers  and his staff to see  within Smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding  designing  and producing?  That’s what Smartsheet looks to achieve.For  Smartsheet  their means of making money is quite simple. As I mentioned  earlier  they are a Software as a Service (SaaS) company. Whenever you  see SaaS  that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that’s a  very good thing. With a subscription business model  the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.Smartsheet’s  primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based Collaborative Work Management (CWM) platform. Customers and  potential customers begin their engagement with the Smartsheet platform  by either signing up for a free trial  purchasing a subscription on the  Smartsheet website  going through a sales rep  or they are exposed to  Smartsheet by collaborating with a Company/Individual that uses  Smartsheet.  For subscriptions  customers select the plan that meets  their needs and can begin using Smartsheet within minutes.Smartsheet  offers four subscription levels: Individual  Business  Enterprise  and  Premier  the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.  Customers can also purchase connectors  which provide data integration  and automation to third-party applications.The  Connectors part of the business is something I find really interesting.  Basically  Smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow  their customers to use those applications within their Smartsheet user  interface. This helps position Smartsheet as the true “command center”  platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary  pieces. You’ll see this on the link above but some products that  Smartsheet sells Connectors for include Adobe Creative Cloud  Microsoft  Dynamics 365  Salesforce  Jira Software  Slack  and Skype just to name a  few.I think that being able to  sell these Connectors as ancillary pieces to the Smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to Smartsheet because a lot of these  companies that people may perceive as “Smartsheet competitors” actually  become a piece of the Smartsheet platform and can be sold by Smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. This neutral angle that Smartsheet is  able to come from by selling Connectors to their perceived “competitors”  reminds me a little bit of how Roku (ROKU) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a Netflix subscription on their platform. I think just the  fact that all these big companies like Adobe  Jira  Salesforce  etc.  allow their products to be integrated into Smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition in the Smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their customers if they didn’t allow for their  products to be integrated with Smartsheet.On  top of the Connectors to third party vendors that Smartsheet is able to  sell  Smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal  plug-ins. Smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can  sell to their customers. For example  in May 2019  Smartsheet acquired  10 000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource  allocation and planning. The name “10 000ft” is meant to be analogous to  having a high level view of your company and all resources available  within your company and how to deploy them.Also   in September 2020  Smartsheet acquired Brandfolder  Inc. which provides  a centralized platform to organize  discover  control  distribute  and  measure all forms of digital content. Combining Brandfolder capabilities  with Smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. This goes back to what I  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that  her company’s marketing team was “really excited about Smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” She told me  that before Smartsheet  her company’s marketing team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team (photographers  graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos  videos  and digital designs  they were working on. She said it was a big pain for them trying to  share this content over email and SharePoint. Now  all of the content is  inside of Smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time.  They can leave comments on the content  route to appropriate individuals  for approvals  and have better insight into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. The acquisition of Brandfolder is  really what allows Smartsheet to stand out in this department.Nobody  really talks about it  but digital content is so important these days  for companies in terms of controlling their brand image  putting out  quality advertisements  and presenting their product in as positive of a  light as possible. The fact that Smartsheet has a strong proprietary  plug-in for this with Brandfolder is very promising. During Smartsheet’s  FY21 Engage Customer Conference  Anna Griffin  Smartsheet Chief  Marketing Officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500B  for companies around the world. She said the role of the marketing  department is changing from sole content creator to Editor in Chief. All  kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that  effects the company’s brand. Sales is running social media campaigns   product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts  and R&D is  teasing new product experiences in app. It can get really difficult for  the company’s Marketing/Branding team to stay on top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like  Brandfolder in Smartsheet. This is just one reason why I think  Smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.As  you can see  Smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core  CWM platform  the Connectors they can sell  and the internal upgrades  available such as 10 000ft and Brandfolder. On top of that  Smartsheet  also provides WorkApps  a proprietary no-code platform that empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline  business and simplify collaboration. There are so many instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow.  Traditionally  companies need to engage their IT departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. This  places a lot of strain on IT departments and takes away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical projects. Mark Mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. He believes that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get work done than an IT department employee who  doesn’t even do the job that the app is being built for. Also  he  believes this will reduce strain on IT departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and mission critical projects.Here  is a quote from the Director of Sales (Hina Patel) at a Smartsheet  customer  Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO): “I have been waiting for a solution like  WorkApps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need   when and where we need it ” said Hina Patel  Director of Sales  Operations at Cisco. “The ability to take our Smartsheet assets  along  with other tools we use  and package an entire solution in an intuitive  app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone  involved in the process  no matter their role.” As you can see  the  value proposition of WorkApps and the Smartsheet platform appears to be  high.Lastly  Smartsheet also  generates revenue from Professional Services which is essentially  providing training and customized consulting to Smartsheet customers  that want to get more out of the Smartsheet platform. In the most recent  quarter  Q3 FY21  Professional Services accounted for 8.2% of revenue.  Here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:Subscription revenue = $90 890M for 91.8% of total revenueProfessional services revenue = $8 043M for 8.2% of total revenueThis  is the end of my first article about Smartsheet. My goal is to drop  Part 2 within the next week. The focus of Part 2 will be an in depth  answer of the question – “Can we 10x from here?”**TL:DR*** This is Part 1 of my two part deep dive on Smartsheet (Ticker: SMAR).* This first part introduces you to (1) me  (2) the company  (3) my thesis on the company  and (4) digs into how they make money.* Part  2 (to be released later this week) will go in depth to explore the  question “Can we 10x from here?” * Smartsheet is an exciting SaaS company that’s helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people* I  am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. These are  just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.**Disclosure:**  I have no position in Smartsheet. I do plan to initiate a long position  when the markets open again in 2021.  I wrote this article myself  and  it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it.

Our own estimate stands at 841K  and based on the 4Q 2020 outcome  we would expect to see consensus 2021 delivery forecasts go up.  We believe that TSLA sales in the U.S. have the potential to benefit from Biden administration policies  potentially including additional tax credits for EV buyers  he added. If there is one concern we have  it would be problems in the Chinese market driven by the growing level of friction between the Chinese and U.S. governments.  Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said earlier this month that the 500 000 delivery target was not even on the map for the Street going back to the late spring/summer timeframe  and forecasts deliveries of as high as 710 000 for the current year  a 40% growth rate that would put Tesla on a strong growth trajectory into 2022.,self,https://redd.it/kq9pwl

The downward trend for the past week is concerning. I’m getting September 2020 vibes from this. Is this a temporary sell off from the ATH or do you feel this is going to get ugly going forward? I wanted to hold Amazon and Apple until the end of the month when earnings are released but I almost feel I should jump out now while I can still at least break even.

I recently did some DD on 3 companies with high potential for an internship application (didn’t get it but whatever). Anyways  I decided to share these with you guys... Enjoy!Cerence (CRNC)- Cerence offers cognitive assistance to the automotive industry: creating meaningful and smart interactions among the driver  passenger  and the automobile.- AI is the future; AI has been enhancing and simplifying every part of human life since its inception. Now  CRNC offers consumers and automobile manufacturers the capability to add AI and voice technology to automobiles. Even though CRNC hit the market in 2019  CRNC has quickly become the market leader in the space. So far  CRNC has displayed great performance  partnering with some of the largest names in the auto industry (BMW and Ford to name a few).- My biggest concern is the potential for competition. Although CRNC is currently leading the market in its respective field  more established names in AI such as Alphabet and Microsoft may undercut the recently launched company.Lithium Americas Corp. (LAC)- Lithium Americas is a resource company that deals in lithium development projects.- LAC is a resource company that could largely benefit from the imminent electric car boom. Due to its chemical composition  Lithium is the main material used in lithium-ion batteries which are used to power electric vehicles; therefore  the electric car boom will clearly be fueled by lithium much like how gasoline fueled the combustion engine cars for generations. In addition  LAC has the capability to mine  refine  and produce lithium carbonate: owning the entire supply chain.- My biggest concern is the present and future value of the company’s main two projects: Cauchari-Olaroz and Thacker. As we can not know the current and future value of lithium  we can not realistically predict the overall return of the two projects. This is not even considering the time and cost of labor it will take to actually mine the lithium from the two sites.AquaBounty (AQB)- AquaBounty is a company that deals currently in aquaculture services  specializing in the farming of bioengineered Atlantic salmon that can grow to market size faster than what the conventional market offers.- The appeal in AQB is clear. As global natural salmon production decreases due to environmental constraints put upon by climate change and pollution  aquaculture of salmonids is already used to meet market demands at a competitive price. Bioengineered salmon is reportedly faster to produce and more efficient; therefore  following conventional logic  bioengineering salmon is the logical next step for a competitive market to meet increasing demands.- My biggest concern is the public perception of GMO foods. As reported by The Hartman Group  consumer perception of GMO foods is increasingly negative year by year. This may pose a potential risk for AQB in the short term.,self,https://redd.it/kqfm6e

I live in Sweden and our currency is called SEK  Swedish crowns. About 70% of my portfolio is stocks (the rest ETF:s) and 100% of those stocks are traded on American markets. The current prognosis of the USD/SEK exchange rate is that the Swedish crown is going to strengthen  hence 1 USD = less Swedish crowns. How should one handle this currency risk? For example  I bought MSFT shares a couple of months ago for $202 per share  today they're $216 which implies a 7% increase in value. Over this period the USD/SEK exchange rate went from 8 8 SEK per USD (which is the rate I bought at) to 8 2 SEK per USD  i.e. a 7% decrease. These two movements cancel out  and I'm break even. How can one handle changes in currency exchange rates? And how can one minimize the effects on his/her investments  mainly stocks and funds.&#x200B;Thank you  Samuel  Sweden,self,https://redd.it/kqh7of

The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100 000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally  I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100 000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.# Call Flow[Call Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/f83491b0-fb16-4481-868d-66f471735f1d)To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV'  'CRM'  'TSLA'  'NKE'  'BABA'  'GM'  'PINS'  'BIDU'  'ZM'  'EEM'  'PLNT'  'MSFT'  'EBAY'  'SPX'  'MA'  and 'DIS'.# Put Flow[Put Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/2db2616e-dee9-4d7d-9fd9-b06fa35e645b)Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts  QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts  CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG'  'AAPL'  'SPY'  'ARKK'  'IWM'  'UAL'  'QS'  'SKT'  'LMND'  'CDLX'  'OLLI'  'GLD'  'GME'  'TSLA'  'QQQ'  'TAN'.# Targeted FlowThe targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume  open interest  premium  expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the Targeted Flow was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.&#x200B;[Targeted Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/ed397f1f-09ef-4c3f-8746-e473ec94fb27)Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising  but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ  GSX  IQ  TSM and FDX  but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100 000 000 in premium....

The DOW Fell 382 points and the NASDAQ Crumbled 1.47%. Marking the worst day for stocks since October 28th! Today was the first day of trading of 2021  and with the move lower it marked a decline in the S&P500 on the first day of trading of a new year for the first time since 2016! The DOW was down as much as 2.4% marking the largest sell off on the index on the first day of trading of a new year since 1932!The market opened higher but began selling off due to what I think was profit taking from 2020 gains in order to defer capital gains taxes to 2022. But the Selloff was ultimately accelerated due to concerns stemming from tomorrow’s Georgia Senate Run-offs.  Two senate seats from Georgia will be voted upon tomorrow and if these two seats flip democrat  it would lead to the Democrats being in control of the Senate. The reason why stocks rallied so much following the November elections was due to the fact that no particular party was in control and therefore the regulatory environment would stay as it has been  very bullish for stocks  for the next 2 years. If the democrats gain control of the senate  Wall street is fearful that tighter regulations could come to the country’s largest companies. Wall street is especially fearful of a tax increase that could effect the bottom lines of these companies. Everyday something happens and I want you to know.,self,https://redd.it/kqlgew

Every time I look at their Yahoo Finance page there's a new article for a contract they were awarded. Earnings and revenue have gone up every year since 2016  institutional ownership is up to 92%  and they have an RSI of 61%.  Operating expenses have gone up while their earnings have also gone up  which leads me to believe the business is growing  successfully.  P/E is extremely high but I think that's because they're viewed by investors as a long term high growth stock  not overvalued. P/B and P/S is average to high average in the aerospace/defense sector but their PEG is sky high.  I THINK that's due to their super high PE which I again think is due to their high growth potential.Point/counterpoint anyone? Stock analysis is a very new thing for me.,self,https://redd.it/kqljmj

Especially with that run up they have to be very volatile.PayPal on the other hand has been the bread and butter for online payments for years it seems. They’re well established and have good growth but at the same time how much more innovative can they be? This was not a DD or anything like that.

Also at support and ascending channel and 200EMA. All indicators are low showing reversal.  &#x200B;$CDXC: Support area on this channel  higher lows recently. Could see 4.40 if it drops more.

Right into channel value  but we need some sign of life. All indicators say it cannot get much lower that this area.  &#x200B;$EPRT: Small channel above an obvious up channel.

Also support are as well  All indicators say a reversal is likely.  &#x200B;$EXEL: Showing life as a small ascending triangle here  but just a great value for this stock.

Right in our value area as well  and the indicators say it should reverse soon.  &#x200B;$GRBK: Great channel up  right at 200EMA  support  and channel value.

I bought 6 months ago at around $16 as a recommendation from a subscription that I won’t name  whom I’m also not following anymore  and since then it’s taken a dive to $11 something.. now with that said  I have 17 Tesla shares but at the time of buying I had planned to buy 20.. the price went up before I could buy so I ended up with 17. I absolutely love Tesla even if I wasn’t an investor I’d be following the company anyway. I plan on buying my last 3 outstanding shares with the money I’ve just taken out of a2 milk.AXThe thing with A2 Milk for me was I don’t care about the company and watching it bring down my portfolio was just annoying when I know there are other companies that I truly love and know they have a much better chance of getting me back the $1000 I lost with A2 I plan this year on building my positions in ARKG  SQ  APPL  Bitcoin and was considering pushing on with Tesla but I feel I need to diversify a bit.

Jack Ma seems to have pissed off the Chinese government by publicly criticizing regulators and now he seems to have disappeared off the face of the earth.The Chinese government doesn’t give a shit  they’re straight up mercenaries. They don’t even pretend to disguise their brutality. For Christ’s sake  they’re genociding an entire group of people (Uighurs  a Muslim minority in western China)!! Point is  if they want you gone  you’re gone. I’m not informed enough to cite specific examples  but haven’t they disappeared billionaires before?? Not making a political statement here  I just want to make money...or rather...avoid losing money due to my BABA position.Sure  Jack Ma could simply be laying low until the heat dies down. No one knows for sure.My question is buy  sell  or hold?My gut is telling me to sell and take the ~12% loss (I got in just a few months ago) and do some tax loss harvesting and repurpose the $ to something more stable. Otherwise  I fear my 12% loss can balloon to 40%.

They acted on guidance regarding the executive order  Jeffrey Halley  a senior market analyst from Oanda told the BBC.That interpretation has clearly changed and the NYSE has moved quickly to change course  he added.The US exchange had planned to delist all three companies as early as this week.Shares of all three companies surged on the Hong Kong stock market - where the companies are also listed - bouncing back after from punishing sessions in both New York and Hong Kong.China Unicom rose by 8.5%  while China Telecom jumped 8% and China Mobile rebounded by 7% on the news.The NYSE indicated that it might revisit the decision  saying it would continue to evaluate the applicability of Mr Trump's Executive Order to the three companies and their continued listing status.## Dual listingsThe three companies earn all of their revenue in China and have no significant presence in the USLike many other large Chinese companies  they have a dual listing in the US and Hong Kong.There are currently more than 200 Chinese companies listed on US stock markets with a total market capitalization of $2.2tn (£1.6tn).In some cases  however  their share listings have became tangled in ongoing diplomatic and trade friction between the US and China.Mr Trump has not only pushed for companies to be delisted  but has targeted a number of Chinese companies including TikTok  Huawei and Tencent on the grounds of national security.China responded with its own blacklist of US companies as tensions between the economic giants escalate.On Monday a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry Hua Chunying had criticised the initial decision to delist the companies as unwise and reflective of how random  arbitrary and uncertain US rules can be.Some analysts expect the end of the Trump administration might lead to a lull in the trade dispute  as the Chinese government waits to see what approach incoming President Joe Biden might take to US-Chinese relations.These are the acts of a dying administration and China will probably be content to await President Biden  and more clarity then over the general path of US China relations from the new administration  said Mr Halley.,self,https://redd.it/kqs0ig

Oddly  while most companies announce guidance on earnings day  AYX tends to make unscheduled guidance announcements  having done so at least twice already.  Also  their CEO got replaced by Mark Anderson from Palo Alto Networks (whom I learned also was at Anaplan for hardly six months before being sacked).  Today  they hired a new Chief Revenue Officer (didn't even know that was a thing).My investment thesis was that with COVID-19 about to come to an end (seemingly so anyway)  companies will need analytics to better assess the post-COVID world and to identify ways forward.  AYX is rated by Gartner to be one of the better analytics tools.  I know that AYX has an unusual method of revenue recognition by recognizing revenue up front as opposed to over the life of the contract  which means that getting new contracts is crucial to AYX (though it might not be as much for some other company like say ADBE).  Apparently  today's guidance reflects that the analytics headwinds might last longer than expected.    Anyway  I am roughly at break even and am wondering if any of you have insights into the company or its prospects.  Any help you can give would be much appreciated.,self,https://redd.it/kqtdae

Several states plan on passing sports betting this year and it’s going to do nothing but bring more traffic to the site. With games getting canceled  different sports getting delayed to different times  and even with the pandemic going on it’s still doubled in its first year.Plus  with the super bowl coming up  they’ll be promoting contests everywhere next month. Great time to buy guys. There’s really only one other competitor (Fanduel) and being in the scene for the past five years  I can tell you that DraftKings is a far superior site and it’s respected much more in the community.

BILI | QS & Other Stock Market News [01-05],News,0.72,16,0,0,6,0,**Stocks take a plunge to start 2021  so is this the start of the next stock market crash? Why did QuantumScape take a plunge yesterday? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news****\~Very Long Post\~**Hello everyone and Good Morning! So  let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the broad stock market having a red day ahead of important events like the Georgia [Election](https://ibb.co/VtxQdmk) of Today  while the US Congress is [scheduled](https://ibb.co/wzqV8PW) to certify the electoral results tomorrow  which will remove any remaining uncertainty due to the political environment as the next president will be inaugurated 2 weeks after that. Yesterday both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HByWLx9) and the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/k04mKGP) finished down almost 1.5% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cht7kGV) did slightly better finishing down 380 points  finishing down on the first trading day of the year for the first time since 2016  as all 3 of them did recovered somewhat after trading even lower intraday. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/rmHnjZj) rising more than 4 points or 18.5%  finishing the day near the 27 level which hasn’t been touched [since](https://ibb.co/mznW197) after the November elections.We saw most of the companies losing ground [yesterday](https://ibb.co/h8sJKh7) with the number of stocks that were trading above the 50-day moving average finally going down below 60%  which in my opinion is a good & healthy correction & consolidation for the stock market  as the volume did pick up after the year-end slow markets.Yesterday 10 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/j4MprMG) finished in the red with Real Estate  Utilities & Industrial losing more than 2.4% while the only small gaining sector was Energy. Meanwhile on a [FACTOR](https://ibb.co/Lzzvr0N) basis the market was more neutral  with most of the groups finishing pretty flat  but the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/v3Yk8PG) from yesterday reveals to us a bloodbath pretty much in the market as stocks were dropping left & right with only a couple of companies posting gains like Tesla  Zoom  Walmart alongside the semis & materials.I think this slight pullback was expected by most analysts  as the greed and bullishness in the stock market was still very [high](https://ibb.co/PDHM90J) to end the year  as we ended the year with more than 46% of investors having a bullish sentiment  pretty near the 1-year high of 55% achieved after the election in November. We didn’t receive many important economic data yesterday  as the construction [spending](https://ibb.co/kXFvYvT) came in at a .9% increase in November  slightly lower than expected and the previous month  but in aggregate it was an increase of 3.8% year/year  while the Manufacturing PMI [index](https://ibb.co/Xkpj85W) came in at just over 57  better than expected and the previous reports  with production growth and new orders being the biggest catalysts.While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/FDyT24L) we receive auto sales numbers  the Redbook chain store sales & the manufacturing index from the ISM.Meanwhile  today we do start to see some of the most anticipated earnings [results](https://ibb.co/4KZBBBW) as this will pick up starting in the middle of January.In some other stock market news  we saw QuantumScape plummeting more than 40% [yesterday](https://ibb.co/0GpXy3f) after they filled to sell more than 300M shares  as this will significantly affect the [shares](https://ibb.co/L0CGPkV) float and the dilution of the company. This is a very high risk with most of the high-flying stocks right now  as the companies are incentivized to issue shares to raise capital  regardless of the share dilution and the impact on shareholders. You can also see this with [Bilibili](https://ibb.co/tYspLZj) that just filled for a $2B offering in Hong Kong.We also saw Taiwan Semi announced a record [CAPEX](https://ibb.co/HN2zPGF) spending for this year  as they [continue](https://ibb.co/m9s85DC) to invest in capital expenditure to improve process capacity and future products as they are expected to have the leading market [share](https://ibb.co/DLZ0jd6) in foundry business this year  which has seen a 24% increase year/year to over $84B.Meanwhile  the New York Stock Exchange reversed its [decision](https://ibb.co/Ry4gfLM) on delisting Chinese telecom companies which finished the day down  but all of them have seen a huge spike after this reversal in after-hours  while most of the Chinese EVs and not only those  but pretty much the whole [industry](https://ibb.co/7QcRM9s)  saw a big spike yesterday after strong sales to finished the year and strong reported demand from China. In the auto-industry we also saw Fiat Chrysler finally agree on a [merger](https://ibb.co/mv4Kp3x) with PSA. The merger will conclude with the company becoming the world’s fourth largest carmaker. They do unfortunately have a lot of things to figure out  as neither of the companies has much exposure in the biggest auto-market in the world  China.So  let’s also take a look at what has usually happened in the stock market after a decline of at least 1% in the first trading day of the year. You can see this has happened 18 [times](https://ibb.co/CPkZzP8) with the Dow Jones  but this has led the index to finish down only 40% of the time in January and for the year  while for the SP500 this has happened just 12 [times](https://ibb.co/MPHN34j)  but also only saw a decline for the month and for the year of about 42% of the time  with the last 2 of the 3 times that this has happened being at the end of the dot com bubble and in the 2008 big financial crisis.So  I think yesterday was a good mix of political volatility combined with profit taking after a huge run in 2020  portfolio rebalancing and of course the treat of new [lockdowns](https://ibb.co/88pj0Yj) just like they started in the UK  which is a pretty perfect storm for the market to have a bad day. I don’t think there is any crash possibilities  but a correction or pullback is possible in the short-term before moving on higher as companies start to have easy comps  restrictions get eased and many more good things toward the end of the year.So  let’s hope for a good day today instead in the market as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bmsPDqL) seem to be pointing to a red open  with the  while the rest of the world is pretty [mixed](https://ibb.co/xLfGFHT) with Japan  France and Germany down  while China & Hong Kong are upThank you everyone for reading!

Although the major averages did finish Monday trading well off their worst levels  the Dow and S&P 500 still posted their largest one-day declines since Oct. 28. The Dow dropped 1.3%  while the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq both fell 1.5%. (CNBC)*****> * Wall Street’s attention will in large part be focused on today’s Georgia runoff elections that will determine control of the Senate. Both Democratic challengers  Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock  must beat GOP incumbents  Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler  to capture the majority for their party. (CNBC)*****> * Senate runoffs in Georgia will shape what Biden can achieve in the White House (CNBC)*****> * The Institute for Supply Management is out with its December manufacturing index at 10 a.m. ET  which is expected to fall slightly to a 57 reading. Meanwhile  automakers release their fourth quarter sales figures for 2020 throughout the morning  with analysts surveyed by Edmunds expecting an overall 5.7% drop on U.S. sales compared to the same quarter in 2019.*****> * Shares of China Telecom (CHA)  China Unicom (CHU) and China Mobile (CHL) were soaring in premarket trading after the New York Stock Exchange said it no longer plans to delist the three Chinese telecommunications giants. It’s a reversal of a decision announced a few days earlier  which had been made in compliance with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump. (CNBC)*****> * Carl Icahn  in remarks to CNBC’s Scott Wapner  warned that stocks could face a significant decline in the future and he indicated he was hedged accordingly. “In my day I’ve seen a lot of wild rallies with a lot of mispriced stocks  but there is one thing they all have in common. Eventually they hit a wall and go into a major painful correction. Nobody can predict when it will happen  but when that does happen  look out below ” the billionaire investor said. (CNBC)*****> * Wharton’s Jeremy Siegel: ‘Dow could easily tack on another 10% to 15% ’ but warns of a near-term setback (CNBC)*****> * British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced another national lockdown for England on Monday  a strict public-health measure he said he hopes will help contain a new  more contagious strain of coronavirus. The U.K. has now reported more than 50 000 new coronavirus infections for seven days in a row  and Johnson said deaths are “up by 20% over the last week and will sadly rise further.” Johnson said he believes the country was entering its “last phase of the struggle” against Covid-19 due to the rollout of vaccines.

Cuomo said he believes the new variant is “much more” prevalent than currently known. (CNBC)*****> * New York Gov. Cuomo to propose law making it a crime to skip the line for Covid vaccine (CNBC)*****> * Just 1% of Californians immunized amid slow vaccine rollout (Associated Press)*****> * The U.S. Food and Drug Administration pushed back on the suggestion to change the dosing or schedules of Covid-19 vaccines  saying the currently available data does not support such alterations. The FDA acknowledged the suggestions were made with the hopes of rolling out the vaccine more broadly to the public. However  with “adequate scientific evidence ” the regulatory agency said it believes changing the dosing amount or delaying the second shot by a few more weeks “may ultimately be counterproductive to public health.” (Reuters)*****> * UK is delaying second vaccine shots and it’s proving controversial. Here’s what we know so far (CNBC)*****> * Ahead of today’s crucial runoff election in Georgia  Republican Sens. Loeffler and Perdue were recipients of a late surge of donations from the real estate and financial industries. Their Democratic opponents  Warnock and Ossoff  had otherwise held advantages in fundraising during the races. (CNBC)*****> * At an outdoor rally in Georgia  Trump declared he intended to “fight like hell” to retain the presidency and appealed to GOP lawmakers to reverse his loss to President-elect Joe Biden when they meet Wednesday to confirm the Electoral College vote. Trump spent much of his speech complaining about his election loss  which he falsely and repeatedly claims he won. (AP)*****> * Supporters of Trump are planning to protest the expected Biden Electoral College vote certification with demonstrations Tuesday night and Wednesday in the nation’s capital. The National Guard has been mobilized to keep the peace in Washington. Trump has encouraged the protesters  tweeting Sunday he will be there. (NBC News)*****> * The joint venture to disrupt health care created by Amazon (AMZN)  Berkshire Hathaway (BRK) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is being disbanded after three years. Known has Haven  the organization was created with the goal of working to lower costs and improve outcomes in health care. The three companies are likely to collaborate informally in the future on health-care initiatives  but the formal end of Haven may be an indication of how challenging it is to dramatically improve American health care. (CNBC)*****> * The chief executive of Qualcomm (QCOM) is retiring later this year and will be replaced by the chipmaker’s president  Cristiano Amon. CEO Steve Mollenkopf  who is 52  took over the job in 2014. His departure comes as the company stands to benefit from the broader rollout of 5G networks. Shares of Qualcomm have gained 96.7% since he became CEO.*****#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://i.imgur.com/jvIPRfY.png)**)*****#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/rbKUzQ8.png)**)*****#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)*****#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cIsTS3G.png)**)*****#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)*****#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Ef4Xvj5.png)**)*****#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png)**)*****#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/pyfRAib.png)**)*****#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png)**)*****#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)NONE.*****#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)NONE.*****#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Gf8L3XX.png)**)######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/HP8dMVe.png)**)######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/s1LDrh6.png)**)######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/Be6rX3U.png)**)*****#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/BQN4tbk.png)**)*****#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/0mEDmbo.png)**)*****#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-micron-technology-first-solar-moderna-more.html)**)*****> **Micron Technology (MU)** – Citi gave the chip and hard drive maker a double upgrade  to “buy” from “sell ” based on its expectation of a long-awaited upturn in DRAM memory chip market.

Small account.,Question,1.0,3,0,0,8,0,Quick background info feel free to skip:I started trading early September and stopped about a week before the election because I thought that market was to volatile and I wasn’t interested in losing money. I was trading real money but only $200. I know  lots of people say I should have paper traded but I have consistent income and despite the risk I thought of it as if that $200 had bought me a new “toy”. I was in it for fun not necessarily profit. I ended up adding another $50 over the course of the weeks I traded. I mostly traded by obsessively watching the news and being a bandwagon. I made it up to $290  up $40. I also ended up losing all of my profit  I don’t remember why I should probably find out so I don’t do it again. Anyways after I lost all my profit I was down to 250 again and with the election near I took my money out.A factor I entirely missed was technical analysis  I wasn’t interested to be frank and just wanted to play the news. Not only that but I didn’t even know exactly what kind of trading I was doing  day trading swing trading and so on. I had zero strategy.I’m getting back into stocks (they’re fascinating and exciting) and a lot of the stuff that didn’t make since before has settled and now makes much more sense but I’m still kind of stuck with a few things.I’d like to swing trade and here are some things I’ve picked up and would like corrected/ confirmed  as well as some follow up.I have seen several swing trading strategy videos where an RSI below 30 is a must. Why is this and how important is this? When doing more research I see people analyzing charts and often times other criteria are met like MACD but the RSI may be at 40 or higher  which again raises the question how important is RSI?What are the most important swing trading indicators in your opinion. From what I can gather it’s RSI  MACD   and moving day averages. That being said I also see people who just make trend lines on consistent graphs (zig zags that are higher peaks higher lows) and these people pretty much just say buy in when the PPS meets the bottom trend line.What are the most useful patterns in your opinion  I see cup and handle being mentioned  the zig zag  and big gap downs where you just wait for the stock to recover. I know there are many more than these but I’m trying to simplify this for myself which is why I only ask to have 3 very good ones provided.Is risk management pretty much as simple as understanding the ratio of how much you can lose vs how much you can make  paired with stop loss orders? Anything more in depth on this is appreciated.I think I understand the general difference between large cap and small cap companies but I don’t understand why you’d trade one over another. So far the only difference I see is that large cap appears more consistent  which I assume is easier to play?What factors go into choosing your price range for stocks? The most consistent I see for swing trading is 15$-$50. Obviously that’s dependent on capital though. Given I’ll start with around $700 where should I aim? The main reason I ask is because the more expensive it is the less shares I own  the more the stock has to run for me to make profit. Whereas I could buy the cheap stock and since I own more shares I need less percent increase to make the same profit? Sorry if these are bad questions or have been asked before. I’ve tried YouTube but every video looks the same or they go over the same things. Three quarters of them don’t even give you a real strategy or real information  they just explain a mindset. I won’t lie I probably could have found this info somewhere but this is so much easier. That being said and resources for those questions are greatly appreciated.,self,https://redd.it/kr0ee0

They will fly again  we just don’t know when. I decided to talk to several engineers about the issue.  If you don’t believe what they said to me then go ask yourself as I am confident you will get similar responses.Here is what they told me:  (consensus)1.	⁠Computer connection is so broad it could be a lose wire to a software issue2.	⁠Because the problem is easy to identify it’s likely easy to fix3.	⁠Virgin Galactic will likely first want to identify and fix the root cause first4.	⁠Virgin Galactic will next want to check everything else to make sure nothing else pops up for when they schedule next test flight5.	⁠Whole process will likely take 1-4 weeks or anything in between.

News broke yesterday that Teledyne would be acquiring FLIR where shareholders would receive $28 in cash and 0.0718 shares of Teledyne for each share owned  equal to a total purchase price of $56 per FLIR share. I'm now trying to figure out what to do with the stock. If the FLIR stock goes over $56 before the transition occurs does that mean I should sell? Any other relevant information here I should consider? I'm not as smart as I'd like to be when stuff like this happens so any help would be appreciated.For reference  I would be paying Long Term Capital Gains (15%) if I sell.Edit: I'm looking for feedback in a mathematical sense on if it makes sense to sell FLIR if it goes over $56 per share prior to the transition.  I don't know all the ins and outs in terms of tax implications  if Teledyne value goes up between now and then  etc... Is there a certain dollar amount per share (if not $56 or higher) that would make sense here to sell rather than hold? Are there other factors I'm not aware of?,self,https://redd.it/kr70fc

I know it is very hard to know exactly what it is but I am interested in at least a simply explanation as to what it might be.  I would assume that securities with higher volumes are less likely to need MMs. Meaning  if I trade NIO today which currently as 142 million in volume I assume I am more likely to be trading with another non-MM right? Now compare this to say to a very ITM option contract I want to sell. That contract could be thousands of dollars and so close to a delta of 1 that buying that as an investor seems useless. I have heard that you should never worry about liquidity because a MM will snatch that up because they can still squeeze out some value from it when it is exercised.

I have about 30k of different stocks I am invested in through E-trade. A Roth IRA that I contribute the max to every year. Along with another 14k account that I have invested with mutual funds through Edward's Jones. I have a checking account  but this 14k is for emergency uses and I only pull out of it when contributing to my Roth if I don't want to pull from my checking. Should I instead split the 14k between ARKK ETF's and take out money from them whenever needed? Would this not be smart because of taxing purposes? I don't know. I feel like it could grow better instead of being in mutual funds. Any advice helps. Thanks!,self,https://redd.it/krccda

Should I auto buy on the same day each week or should I manually try to buy the same dollar amount each week on whichever day dips?,Advice Request,0.81,6,0,0,6,0,I understand a single day dip might not necessarily be considered a dip. I’m new to investing and I can only afford to invest a small amount each week rather than a lump sum. Wondering if I should set a reoccurring investment for the same day each week or try to snipe the most affordable day that week. Obviously it’s unpredictable but right now I invest on Wednesdays and almost every week all my stocks are on an up by the time my buy goes through. Not exactly the same as DCA from my brief understanding. If I set to reoccurring is there a better day of the week on average to buy? Thanks!,self,https://redd.it/krcejg

It’s ok to have a collection of ETFs vs owning individual stocks.8. Don’t track dollar amount but what your % return is. You get out what you put in. It’s all relative to % of movement.9. Have an exit plan for individual stocks.10. Stop saying “I know it’s not much” it’s something and it will grow. By investing when you’re under 30 you’re doing yourself a huge favor later in life than you know and way ahead of your generation or even your parents.11. **Patience  Patience  Patience**12.

Is the jump to absolutely self-driving cars really necessary? What difference does it make? So that passengers can sleep behind the wheel or drink? I would think regulators would forbid this even in the case of self-driving cars as there would always need to be a failsafe or someone behind the wheel who can intervene in emergencies.Personally I enjoy driving short to medium distances and even longer ones aren't that bad every now and then. It just seems like something companies are putting so much money and effort into without really meeting a broad costumer demand.&#x200B;Update: This questions is just regarding consumer vehicles  not logistics or long-distance trucking. ,self,https://redd.it/krithd

In exchange  you get unparalleled internet access and connectivity across the globe  for no out of pocket costs.Meanwhile  for a similar level of experience through Apple  you have to pay Apple a considerable amount out of pocket. Ok. Fine.I feel like there's room for both approaches. I just dont get why Facebook has to be so vilified when theyre providing a quality product for free.

Why?!  Three big reasons.&#x200B;1. **Leadership and Potential**:  BBBY is a **start up with the financials of a fortune 500 company**.   BBBY  over the last year  changed its entire management team.  A new  group of senior executives with experience ranging from amazon  target   nike  etc.  Check out their video and look up some of their names.   Incredible turnover of leadership. [https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/vfyg6s3k](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/vfyg6s3k)  And they've done some good work over the past year.  BBBY only has to  beat itself.  I'm not saying this will be the next 200 dollar stock.   But at 20 dollars a share  a rise to 40 alone would be 100%.  This stock  has been beaten down so badly (and rightfully so); however  I think the  drive from this leadership team can really do the company some good.   This leadership team is focused on investing in the company  cutting out  excess that doesn't work  and zeroing in on what captured BBBY as a  leading brand many years ago.2. BBBY is already **streamlining its stores**.   They are closing down stores that were in close proximity to each  other so they are not in direct competition with each other.  Closing  down stores will help them save money  and it shouldn't hurt their sales  because of their proximity to others.  They are also changing the  interior design of their stores to inspire consumers to purchase various  set-ups as opposed to individual pieces.  There are powerful articles  in consumer-psychology around the detriments of choice.  When there is  too much to choose from  the brain becomes more hesitant and indecisive.   BBBY is changing the layout of their stores to reflect this.  By  inspiring consumers first with entire set-ups  they are locking  consumers in on what they want  which helps them focus on the particular  products they are looking for.  They are also increasing their online  marketplace presence and bettering the user experience.3. The  macrotrend of **remote work and the demand for home-based goods is likely to last**.  Many companies are now grappling with remote vs office work.   Some big names already came out and said that remote work will be in  place for all of their employees until the summer of 2021.  I think many  companies will realize that a hybrid of remote/office work is  preferrable.  It can save companies money as they do not need to have a  bigger office space and  arguably  it increases the efficiency of their  employees.  It's about how well you work  not how much.  Post-pandemic  I  don't think we'll have a full 180 reversal of everyone going back into  the office.  Remote work will definitely leave its footprint  and that  gives BBBY potential to grow.For a further look into some of the moves BBBY has made:  [https://www.retaildive.com/news/one-year-in-mark-trittons-turnaround-at-bed-bath-beyond/587680/](https://www.retaildive.com/news/one-year-in-mark-trittons-turnaround-at-bed-bath-beyond/587680/)Check out a number of youtube videos on the stock! (wasn't allowed to post them for some reason  but the info is out there!)BBBY earnings is tomorrow.  I plan on increasing my position today to 2-3% with the end-goal of around 4-5%.  That way I can see how the price reacts after-earnings.,self,https://redd.it/krms4i

Is Alibaba going to recover or is it going down? GM outperforms in 2020  let’s talk about this and other stock market news**Hello everyone and Good Morning! So  let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market recovering a good part of the losses from the first trading day of 2021  as the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P4FW6dK) gained almost 1%  the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Jd46zGb) rose by .71% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cs47MP1) finished 167 points higher. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/kH2gz8v) dropping by more than 6% after the huge spike on Monday as more than 70% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/59qrWLY) on average volume with 109 new highs. We saw 8 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hFqx3Gg) finish the day in the green  lead by Energy up over 4% and Materials up over 2%  while Consumer staples finished flat and Utilities & Real Estate just finished in the red.Most small & mid-cap value & core companies were outperforming [yesterday](https://ibb.co/dWszjdG)  as large-caps did finish mostly flat.Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gDLn3Bc) from yesterday which revels plenty of gains in most of the areas of the stock market  with Big Tech companies advancing moderately  while most of the Oil& Gas industry finished up significantly higher alongside companies from China.The economic data that we received yesterday was mostly positive  starting with bankruptcy fillings falling to the lowest monthly number since early 2006  continuing the trend of this year  as this number  is the [lowest](https://ibb.co/26hzbrN) we have seen since 1986  as companies have been hugely supported by fiscal and monetary policies with record-breaking capital injections.We also saw the December ISM Manufacturing [INDEX](https://ibb.co/q73Fj2m) coming at 60.6  higher than the 56.6 expected and the 57.5 in the previous month. This was led by a growth in new orders  productions  prices index & supplier deliveries  while the employment index changed direction and was in expansion territory again this month  standing at 51.5. This was the highest PMI we have seen in 2020  with December being the 7th straight month of [expansion](https://ibb.co/12gpyy2) and the biggest one of this year  with this PMI corresponding to a 5.2% increase in GDP on an annualized basis  as we also saw a 5.5% increase on a yearly basis in the latest Redbook chain store [SALES](https://ibb.co/qWjH5dJ).[TODAY](https://ibb.co/2n4jcFm) we continue to get auto sales numbers  MBA mortgage applications  ADP jobs numbers  factory orders and a final read on the PMI composite  as we also await the Georgia Runoff [ELECTION](https://ibb.co/zXyZWmR) final results  as right now one of the seats has been called by multiple media channels for the Democrats while the other one is still too tight to call.If the Dems to sweep  this could cause an increased volatility in the markets  especially in the tech sectors as investors would probably overreact and just start selling off. This could be a good buying opportunity in my opinion  as I believe it’s very unlikely that even if Democrats do have the power to make big changes  which is very unlikely on big & important subjects as they themselves are divided on many subjects  they wouldn’t do that when things are still very bad in the economy  and the future still looks uncertain. Things should get better before any “big tax changes” or any other “big regulation changes”. So  if the Dems win the other seat  expect volatility  that could lead to a healthy correction after a huge run or a consolidation period before the markets recovers. So  I just wouldn’t bet against the bull market that we are in right now.In some other stock market news  we saw a report that Alibaba is [planning](https://ibb.co/s2vb2L8) to raise $5B through bonds again  following the 2014 and 2017 capital raising operation  with the company also getting downgraded at CFRA to a sell [rating](https://ibb.co/QbJwG53) while also cutting their PT from $280 to $210. I know the political factors are really pushing this stock in the wrong direction  but after all of this will pass  Alibaba is still a great company  even [without](https://ibb.co/m4x7CCs) Ant Group and despite the latest moves by trump to continue banning Chinese [APPS](https://ibb.co/X8xr9Cs)  with the latest big ones being Alipay & WeChat Pay. In my opinion this is a severe overreaction as long-term investing goes. Yeah  maybe in the short-term the company can go either way depending on what restrictions they get  but I really don’t think Alibaba will go bust in the long-run.Yesterday we also receive auto sales number from a couple of manufacturers  with [GM](https://ibb.co/6HhqwZr) stealing the show  with Q4 sales up almost 5% year/year  as the company estimated they gained market share in both retail and fleet deliveries in 2020  while NISSAN’s [sales](https://ibb.co/gFhYd60) continued to drop  as they sold 19% less vehicles in Q4 over the last quarter  as the total sales in 2020 dropped by more than 33%  as the automaker has fallen out of flavor with outdated models and no innovative developments.Meanwhile [VW](https://ibb.co/st5S7fh) did slightly worse overall in 2020  but saw a 11% increase in sales in Q4  as this was led by a 22% increase in the total SUVs sold. The SUV trend continues to keep on getting more & more meaningful and most automakers must try and compete in this highly demanded market if they do want to survive. If you do want to invest in this industry  I suggest you take a look at the product development & future outlook for the company before. I think both GM & Ford are going in the right direction  but you should do your own research.So  let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [world](https://ibb.co/55PMcBq) stock markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bN3RK87) seem to be pointing to a mixed open  with the Dow leading the way  while the tech heavy Nasdaq is down almost 1.3% on panic selling & portfolio rebalancing happening due to the possible Democratic sweep in Georgia.Thank you everyone for reading!

Losses on No. 2 Apple (AAPL) in 2020 came to $6.7 billion  which is only slightly more than Tesla shorts lost in the month of December alone. Amazon (AMZN) cost the shorts $5.8 billion  according to S3.Many of the shorts were forced to admit defeat last year. About two-thirds of the short positions were unwound during 2020  which in itself was a factor that helped drive Tesla shares higher  as the short investors were forced to buy higher-priced shares to exit their positions.But the year ended with short investors still holding roughly 5.5% of Tesla's shares  which equates to a $31 billion bet against the company's future prospects. For comparison  there is $13.3 billion and $10.2 billion currently bet against Apple and Amazon respectively  with shorts controlling less than 1% of each of those companies' stocks.,self,https://redd.it/krp7jn

By December 1st it had plummeted to the point where I lost $100  I figured it would go back up once approved for emergency use but that also was not the case.  I feel like the slow rollout of the vaccine along with not meeting their expectations has had a lot to do with it.  To this day I fluctuate at around down $250 on Moderna.  I don’t know what to do at this point because I don’t want to lose more but I would love for it to go up again  so I can at least break even.  I’ve heard it will go up rapidly once it is approved for public use but I have no heard anything about when that will be.What would be your guys’ recommendations as to what I should do with my Moderna shares.

I haven't done any DD's before and I mean  I just want a discussion started. I haven't looked at the financial aspects of this company either  it's more about the fact that I like the idea  so please don't be rude. So  Goodfood Market is a Canadian company which delivers the groceries for predetermined meals including the recipe etc. I assume it's quality groceries  e.g. free range  organic  not too bad for the environment etc.  so every millennials/big city persons dream.   I'm from Europe and we have HelloFresh here as the biggest player in the market [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HFG.F/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/HFG.F/) (12B in Market Cap). My first question  in North America  which are the similar companies that does this? Like  in the US  there gotta be someone who does something similar like HelloFresh and this Goodfood Market? The usage of companies like these have exploded during corona  the question is just how many people are going to continue use it? Environment  health  animal rights  financial independence are all super in topics right now. I could imagine many young professionals living in big cities using services like these? You save time  you don't have to get creative (they do it for you)  you eat healthy  there is something about cooking your own meal and compared to eating out  it is just cheaper.   Can someone tell me the competitors here? I would assume a Canadian company would enter the US market at some point if it booms. The market cap is less than 1B  but it had huge growth lately. Again  if someone with a strong economic background could throw some facts at me I would really appreciate it. But I like the concept (I know it's not necessarily new) and as a young professional (soon  studying last year of Master's in CS) I would be inclined to use a service like this.

That's a 66% new accounts growth from q3  which itself had 43% new account growth (3 million accounts added q3). This is above analyst expectations for q4 of 50.3 million accounts.Streaming hours grew 15%  from 14.8 billion to 17 billion for a total of 58.7 billion hours streamed in 2020  a 45.6% growth rate YoY. This is above analyst expectations of 16.3 billion hours for q4.  Streaming hours is relevant because advertisers are willing to pay more as account engagement rises  which is a multiplier on revenue growth. Something interesting to note - among advertisers with total spend greater than $1 million  Roku had a 100% customer retention rate  which indicates a high level of satisfaction with Roku's ad platform. In Q3 Roku managed to not only retain 100% of those customers  but also renegotiated the contracts at higher rates more favorable to Roku.,self,https://redd.it/krqz5k

That is because the Jan 22  2021 $770.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.### What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However  implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\- ADVERTISEMENT -### What do the Analysts Think?Clearly  options traders are pricing in a big move for Netflix shares  but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently  Netflix is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Broadcast Radio and Television industry that ranks in the Bottom 30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days  two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter  while none have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.37 per share to $1.38 in that period.  Given the way analysts feel about Netflix right now  this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes  options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration  the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.,self,https://redd.it/krr4q5

As in 1.4 billion people big. I think it's highly likely that it will overtake the US within the next decade. It's the heavyweight of manufacturing  global exports  and it is the world's biggest food producer. Between 1977 and 2017  China's economy grew almost 10 000%. Let that sink in. The biggest banks are no longer Citi or JP Morgan; the top players are all Chinese. If you have heard or read about the Great Firewall you will know about the billionaires that own Tencent and Alibaba. There's been a lot of people speculating to sell Alibaba because Jack Ma has gone missing. Some are arguing that one should sell BABA because it is doomed and some - who I would have to side with - are saying buy the dip as it will rise back up once the politics have been resolved. Just today I saw that NYSE reversed their decision to de-list 3 Chinese telecom companies. Once the news broke  the firms’ stock prices surged. This is a good signal that international relations are improving - i.e.  quite unlikely that China will liquidate BABA. There are a lot of US and EU investors in BABA  Tencent  and more to come. Also  if China did do that  imagine the trade-war that America would unleash. You also have to consider how China wants to keep growing and to do this  they need a free flow of money. China has a complicated relationship with global financial markets and is basically a communist country. You have state intervention that you would never see here in the West. Quick history lesson: Foreign investors not that far back were unable to buy any Chinese shares. However  since allowing it (*see: QFII program  circa 2002*)  the flow of free money  Chinese stocks have grown. Ask yourself  are China now suddenly going to reverse this boom? Who really knows  but I highly doubt it. It is worth noting that foreign ownership is capped at 30%. If Chinese investors dumped a given stock  foreign investors (that's me and you) could find themselves inadvertently holding more than 30% and then be forced to sell at market price - which would probably be pennies. Under Xi Jinping  the Govt's control has been getting tighter - meaning that a stock's fortune could change suddenly. However  markets in China are used to benefit the Chinese people. In short  if the market moved in a way that was not beneficial to China's rise  the Chinese Govt would not hesitate to intervene. So  a good question to ask yourself when investing in companies like BABA and Tencent is: Do these stocks benefit the Chinese Govt?? To help answer this  look at Chinese Funds and Chinese Institutional Investment as well as knowing that they already own 70%. If the answers are yes  I think it unlikely that the Govt would put a grenade under their best-performing stocks. The biggest issue with Chinese stocks is their accounting and auditing - -this becomes less of an issue for large-cap stocks. The US-China trade war has taken its toll on China. Harsh tariffs on Chinese goods have reduced demand for their products as well as reduced profit margins. Because of this  their manufacturing industry shrank throughout 2019. Risk-averse investors will probably want to wait on the sidelines and wait for a resolution to be reached. However  as some famous guy once said 'Buy when others' are fearful'. China also has many other problems such as a shrinking population and the national debt is increasing  meaning they want their companies to be as successful as possible. They can't afford to simply write off companies - profitable ones at that - to simply show Jack Ma who's boss. Granted they will give him a dressing down  strip him of his assets; or even put him in jail. But hurting their own companies?? This doesn't make sense. ***Prediction:*** I am Bullish on both BABA and Tencent. I actually love Tencent because of their 40% holdings in Epic Games. Clue: Unreal Engine > Mandalorian. **America**Tech companies in the US have been getting bigger  and bigger (especially during the Coranavirus pandemic). Unless you've been asleep  you would have seen that Amazon wants to relocate its operations to Cyprus (link:[https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/amazon-buys-cyprus-08122020](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/amazon-buys-cyprus-08122020)). If this happens  their presence would be so immense they would literally be able to buy political influence across all levels and lobby for tax rebates. The Cyprian Govt would happily lobby for the company in the EU Parliament. The EU would not allow this and would enforce sanctions against Amazon as well as teaming up with the US Govt to fight such a monopoly. We live in a democracy and we've been quite successful for a few centuries now. If we suddenly had a superpower rising that would create an imbalance in the system. For instance  the profits of Amazon circa 2009 grew from less than $1BN to $10BN in 2019. However  the amount of federal tax it pays is close to zero. With the US Govt (and many others) short on cash due to printing/borrowing money  they will need large corps to start paying their fair share of tax (and then some). Meaning profits will go down moving forward. There is an active effort by the US and EU Govts to punish these kinds of monopolies. Many IBs and Strategists see all these tech giants - Apple  Microsoft  Amazon  Facebook - being persecuted by the Govt. If you have been holding tech stocks for a long time like me  good for you. Keep your stocks. However  if you are new to the game of investing  I would consider personally ETFs in tech rather than the stock itself. For example  the QQQ tracks the Nasdaq-100 and has about 50% of its holdings in Amazon  Google  Apple  and Microsoft. ***Prediction:*** After seeing Amazon & Microsoft  trade sideways for 5months now  I do think they will reach another peak soon from Covid-related sales  however  I do think that will be short-lived. Apple and Google have seen massive rises over the last 6-months. Apple was because they are going to start making cars  which will take a long time. It took Tesla almost 17 years. I see the upside for these stocks being modest gains  while the downside will most likely be what's happened to me: Opportunity Cost - whereby your money will be tied for months on end doing nothing. Neither up nor down. Disclaimer: I have been holding both Alibaba and Amazon for years now. I even bought more shares during the most recent dip of BABA.

[BETZ vs. DKNG] [JETS vs. LUV] [MGM vs. CZR],Advice,0.8,8,0,0,19,0,When it comes to ETF's vs Stocks which would be the better buy between these pairs. I own positions in all but would like to just choose one and increase my position in them. Right now I'm about 50/50 in each.\[BETZ vs. DKNG\]BETZ has DKNG and PENN but in small percentages (\~5%) so a big rise in DKNG would not show very well in the ETF but it is less volatile in the end. I so see DKNG being a leader in the field but the ETF has more diversity in the whole online gambling sector.\[JETS vs. LUV\]JETS has a large stake in LUV with around 10% which is nice and the second biggest being DAL at around 9%. Both really good companies so I can see JETS increasing nicely once things get back to normal. However there are many other airlines in there that aren't as good and may not be around if the pandemic continues. LUV is awesome with domestic travel and I believe that is what everyone will be doing once the pandemic ends but who knows. They also have a great balance sheet same with DAL.\[MGM vs. CZR\]MGM has its online sports booking (Betmgm) but also owns a ton of the Las Vegas strip. Growth potential is huge when things get back to normal and people flood to Las Vegas. I feel the same way about CZR but after they merged with El Dorado they've had a pretty good run but could definitely go higher. I'd rather remove one and put it in the other.Any Thoughts?,self,https://redd.it/krt2sd

It also is much cheaper and newer than VTI at just over 10 years old. But the trend since inception has been only upward obviously since it supposedly mirrors the total US market like VTI. Basically what’s the major difference and should I shift my funds over to the iShare counterparts from my Vanguard ETFs?,self,https://redd.it/krtfw7

They offer something more than the others?Thanks in advance from Italy :),self,https://redd.it/krthuf

Fee isn’t too bad .4% plus there is a 2% annual dividend. Best part is while lots of infrastructure and energy plays have run up big  IFRA is just now reaching pre-pandemic highs  plenty of room to grow in an infrastructure heavy economy  as is expected.
