       "\"Was just wondering what to do if you were me I have a IRA with Wells Fargo. My positions are. 1 Amazon. 2 Google. 5 Microsoft. 10 Apple.I'm not interested in doing anything with Google  Microsoft  or Apple. I want to keep all these. My question is what should I do with my 1 Amazon. Obviously I can just keep it. After it fell $50 today and has fallen past days I'm not to far off my average cost again.I'm interested in Nvidia so I could just sell Amazon and grab 5 nvidia to replace it with. I'm also interested in Tesla  so same thing. Could sell Amazon and grab 5 Tesla or something.Like I said though I could just do nothing. I'm assuming Amazon has the possibility to hit $3500 to $4000 by the end of the year. It hasn't done much movement in the past 9 months though.I'm not a newbie to this stock trading thing just wondering about opinions. 1 Amazon  5 Tesla  5 Nvidia  X Shares of something else.Looking for advice. If you're me what you doing tomorrow with my 1 share of amazon?\""
